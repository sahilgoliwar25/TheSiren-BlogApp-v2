        "New Delhi: Varun Dhawan has served up a hot take on his own film Bawaal and Hollywood release Oppenheimer, both of which have been criticized for controversial scenes. Bawaal, directed by Nitesh Tiwari, features the Holocaust as a plot point, comparing a troubled marriage to Hitler's regime and concentration camps like Auschwitz. The film features lines like this one spoken by Janhvi Kapoor's character: Hum sab bhi toh thode bohot Hitler jaise hi hai na (we all are a little bit like Hitler). Speaking to Pinkvilla, Varun pointed out that his character is meant to be grey. What I dont understand like how Sir (Nitesh Tiwari) said that its a context and the protagonist is from Lucknow and its showing that the character which is Ajju Bhaiya is initially a tone-deaf character.",

Your chance of developing some diseases may be decreased by other variables, such as overeating and drinking alcohol in excess of what is considered reasonable. Many people believe that heredity has a significant role in determining life expectancy. But the influence of genes is significantly less important than previously thought. Environmental aspects including diet and lifestyle turn out to be important. Your chromosomal ends shorten as you become older. You are more prone to fall ill as a result. However, lifestyle modification can increase an enzyme that lengthens them. Additionally, research suggests diet and exercise can aid in protecting them.

With a delivery both fierce and breathy, O'Connor sold millions of records following the 1990 album I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, which saw her star skyrocket after she had gained a cult following from her debut The Lion and the Cobra. Here is a sampling of her top hits: Nothing Compares 2 U O'Connor's best-known hit by far was Nothing Compares 2 U, a track Prince wrote and the Irish singer turned into a power ballad evoking the painful emptiness experienced by a jilted lover. The melancholy 1990 smash soared to the top of the charts worldwide, reigning over the US top songs list for four weeks. It was also royalty on MTV, where O'Connor's stark music video received heavy rotation. Frames of her tightly shot facial features and tears became one of the emblematic images of 1990s music. The critically acclaimed track is a regular on best all-time songs lists.",

Various features such as Kia Connect (previously known as UVO) and autonomous safety tricks built into the car have helped set the Kia Seltos apart from the strong competition in the segment. Kia has now unveiled the 2023 facelift for the Kia Seltos, which comes with further improvements to the already rich feature set of the car, along with a new premium 'X-line' trim, and improved engine and transmission options across variants.

Nintendo doesn't have an official presence here at all, Sony never really promoted the PS Vita, and there's no hope of the Steam Deck coming in anytime soon. There clearly is some demand, evidenced by the easy availability of grey-market Nintendo Switch units, online listings for niche Chinese manufacturers such as Ayaneo, and even small yet vocal crowds of retro console enthusiasts in forums online. However, they're a microscopic niche compared to smartphone gamers here, with PUBG/BGMI becoming a cultural phenomenon and even casual titles making enormous money. Over 500 million Indians are estimated to play games on their smartphones; double what the figure was just five years ago. That's incredible in terms of sheer market potential. But what games are these people playing, how much are they willing to spend, and how does the hardware and software fit into their lives?

Globally, an estimated 354 million individuals are affected by hepatitis B or C, with many lacking accesses to testing and treatment. Hepatitis poses a significant social and economic burden on India, with over 40 million people infected with hepatitis B and 6 to 12 million people chronically infected with hepatitis C. To diagnosis hepatitis, a doctor will assess the patient's symptoms, study their medical history and conduct a physical examination of the liver to test for swelling. Blood tests are taken to check enzymes levels in the liver, as well as to determine the type of hepatitis. A liver ultrasound and biopsy might be conducted to check for inflammation and liver damage.",

      description:
        "Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fatty acids that are essential for good health. There are three main types of omega-3 fatty acids: ALA, EPA, and DHA. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids are important for good health due to several reasons. For one, omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases by reducing inflammation, lowering triglyceride levels, and preventing the formation of blood clots. \nDHA, specifically, is a major structural component of the brain and is important for brain development and function. Consuming omega-3-rich foods has been associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline, improved memory, and a reduced risk of mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. DHA is also found in high concentrations in the retina of the eye and is important for maintaining good vision and reducing the risk of age-related macular degeneration. \nOmega-3 fatty acids are often assumed to be a nutrient found in meats and other non-vegetarian foods. However, there are a variety of vegetarian foods that are abundant in this nutrient. Read on as we share a list of vegetarian foods you can add to your daily to increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids. \n10 Vegetarian foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids: \n1. Chia seeds \nChia seeds are one of the best plant-based sources of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). ALA is essential for brain health and may help reduce inflammation, lower cholesterol levels, and support heart health. \n2. Flaxseeds \nFlaxseeds are another excellent source of ALA. Including flaxseeds in your diet can help improve digestive health, reduce the risk of heart disease, and support healthy skin and hair. \n3. Hemp seeds \nHemp seeds are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, including ALA. Consuming hemp seeds may support heart health, reduce inflammation, and improve overall immune function. \n4. Walnuts \nWalnuts offer a great balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Regular consumption of walnuts may help lower blood pressure, improve brain function, and reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases. \n5. Brussels sprouts \nBrussels sprouts are a cruciferous vegetable that contains omega-3 fatty acids. These green gems are rich in antioxidants and fibre, which aid digestion, reduce inflammation, and support heart health. \n6. Algal Oil \nAlgal oil, derived from algae, is a marine-based vegetarian source of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA and EPA. It supports brain health, reduces inflammation, promotes healthy eyes, and benefits heart health. \n7. Seaweed \nSome seaweed varieties, such as nori, offer omega-3 fatty acids. Seaweed is also a good source of iodine and antioxidants, and it supports healthy thyroid function and improves heart health. \n8. Spirulina \nSpirulina, a blue-green algae, contains significant amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. Adding spirulina to your diet can boost energy levels, support the immune system, and reduce inflammation. \n9. Edamame \nEdamame, or young soybean pods, is a rich source of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Edamame is also high in protein, fibre, and antioxidants, which help lower cholesterol levels, maintain bone health, and support heart health. \n10. Soybeans \nSoybeans are another legume that contains omega-3 fatty acids. Incorporating soy-based products like tofu, soy milk, or tempeh into your diet can help reduce the risk of heart disease, support bone health, and alleviate menopausal symptoms. \nRemember, it's important to consume a variety of omega-3-rich foods to obtain a balanced intake of fatty acids. Additionally, if you're vegetarian or vegan, consider supplementing with plant-based omega-3 supplements (such as algae-based omega-3 capsules) to ensure adequate intake.",

        'Amid heavy rainfall in Delhi and nearby areas over the past few weeks, conjunctivitis has become a prevalent concern. Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is the most common type of eye infection. The humid weather offers a favourable environment for bacteria and viruses to grow and spread, contributing to increased cases of highly contagious eye infections. "We are getting at least 100 cases of conjunctivitis per day. There is usually a seasonal increase in conjunctivitis cases, which coincides with the flu season. The conjunctivitis cases are mostly caused by a virus," Dr JS Titiyal, chief of RP Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences at AIIMS said. \nSchools in Delhi have also reported rising cases of eye infection. It has also been noted that the infection is highly contagious and symptoms last for three to four days. \nAs conjunctivitis and other eye infections are spreading fast these days, we spoke to experts to understand the exact cause and tips to manage and prevent these. \nEye infection during monsoon: Know causes, treatment, prevention, symptoms and more \nSymptoms \nRed eyes, itching, eye pain, watery eyes, swelling, discharge from eyes, blurred vision and sensitivity to light are a few common symptoms of eye infection. \nRain and eye infections: What is the connection? \nThe surge in the number of cases can be attributed to various factors. \n"The combination of increased humidity and warmer temperatures during the rainy season produces ideal circumstances for the rapid reproduction of bacteria and viruses. Additionally, waterlogging of the contaminated water allows bacteria and germs to multiply quickly," said Dr Aparna Darshwal, HOD - Ophthalmology, Metro Hospital, Faridabad. \nHow to manage eye infections during monsoon \n"Relying on home treatments may not be sufficient in the majority of cases. It is better to visit with an ophthalmologist to get timely treatment. Self-medication is also not advisable in such circumstances," Dr Darshal advised. \nTreatment for eye infection \nThe current medical recommendation involves the use of antibiotic drops. "However, the type of infection can vary, whether it\'s viral or bacterial, and the severity may differ as well. Consequently, some cases may respond well to a single antibiotic drop, while others may require a combination of drops and ointments to effectively treat the condition. The treatment approach will be tailored according to the specific nature and severity of the eye infection to ensure the best possible outcome," Dr Johri explained. \nWhat should patients do at home? \nHome remedies alone can be inadequate to address the issue effectively. "However, it is recommended to follow a simple yet essential action that is washing the eyes with clean water at least three times a day, ensuring that the water makes direct contact with the eyeballs," Dr Johri added. \nIt is important to follow the prescribed dosage recommended by your doctor to ensure effective and safe management of the condition.',

        "OnePlus 12 is expected to be launched in global markets including India in January next year. Although the launch is several months away, a Chinese tipster has leaked the phone's camera details. The OnePlus 11 5G successor is said to carry a Hasselblad-branded triple rear camera unit, headlined by a 50-megapixel Sony IMX9xx 1/1.4-inch primary camera. Last year, the Chinese smartphone company fitted a similar 50-megapixel triple rear camera setup on the OnePlus 11 5G. The OnePlus 12 is said to run on Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC. It is expected to pack a 5,400mAh battery with support for 100W wired charging and 50W wireless charging. \nKnown tipster Digital Chat Station (translated from Chinese) has leaked the camera details of the OnePlus 12 on Weibo. As per the tipster, the upcoming handset will have a Hasselblad branded triple rear camera setup, comprising a 50-megapixel Sony IMX9xx 1/1.4-inch primary camera, coupled with a 50-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 64-megapixel OmniVision OV64B periscope camera with 3x optical zoom. \nGoing by the leaked specifications, the camera setup on the OnePlus 12 appears to have a slight boost over the OnePlus 11 5G. The latter packs a triple rear camera unit including a 50-megapixel 1/1.56-inch Sony IMX890 sensor with optical image stabilisation (OIS), a 48-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera with a 0.5-inch Sony IMX581 sensor, and a 32-megapixel telephoto camera with a 1/2.74-inch Sony IMX709 sensor. \nThe OnePlus 12 has been in the rumour mill for quite some time now. A recent leak suggested the specifications of the handset. It is said to run on Android 14 with OxygenOS 14 on top. The upcoming handset could feature a 6.7-inch fluid LTPO AMOLED display with a 2K resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. Qualcomm's unannounced Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is expected to power the OnePlus 12. It is tipped to come with 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage. \nFor selfies, the OnePlus 12 might pack a 32-megapixel sensor on the front, arranged in the hole punch cutout on the display. It is said to feature an alert slider and an in-display fingerprint scanner for authentication. The handset is also said to house a 5,400mAh battery with fast 100W wired charging support and 50W wireless charging support. \nTo recall, the OnePlus 11 5G was launched in India in February with a price tag of Rs. 56,999 for the 8GB + 128GB0 storage configuration.",

        "Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 4 was a big upgrade over the Galaxy Z Flip 3. It managed to turn, what was a more fashion-forward foldable, into a very useful and practical smartphone with major improvements to its cameras and battery life. With the new Galaxy Z Flip 5, Samsung has added even more features to the mix. There's now a bigger cover display with its own widget-based interface, a new processor and improvements to the cameras. I got to spend some time with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 at the Galaxy Unpacked launch event, and here are my first impressions. \nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5's overall design has not changed by much and it still offers an IPX8 rating for water proofing. However, look closely and you'll quickly notice the expanded glass on the front that manages to hide a large 3.4-inch, Super AMOLED 60Hz display underneath. This new larger display has a resolution of 720 x 748 pixels (306ppi). Tapping on it wakes up the oddly shaped display which resembles a folder icon from Windows or Mac OS. \n Samsung's approach to the cover display's design on the Galaxy Z Flip 5 is very different compared to Motorola's more radical design for the same. The cover display on the Flip 5 has some really thick bezels on the top, left and right sides with a cutout at the bottom which completely avoids the LED flash and the two cameras. \nThe inner display on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 has not seen much of an upgrade. It seems to be the same 6.7-inch full-HD+ Dynamic AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate in a 22:9 aspect ratio. It still feels a bit cramped when browsing through content vertically. However, the aspect ratio of this main display keeps its footprint quite compact compared to other foldables such as the Oppo Find N2 Flip. The phone's weight is the same as before (187g) but is slimmer when folded (by 2mm) thanks to the new hinge mechanism. \nAccording to Samsung, the new hinge is more durable when subjected to drops or shocks and also allows for the zero-gap design between the two halves of the clamshell when folded shut (apart from reducing the display's crease). \nSamsung has gone with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform for Galaxy in the Galaxy Z Flip 5, which is a customised version of the standard chipset just like on the Galaxy S23 series which launched earlier this year. Samsung claims that the new chipset brings improvements to image quality and battery life. \nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 will be offered in two storage variants. The first with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage and the second with 512GB of storage, which is an improvement over last year's model which had a 128GB base variant.\nThe phone follows Samsung's recent trend with the standard Galaxy S23 series and offers the same camera hardware as on the previous Galaxy Z Flip 4. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 has a 12-megapixel primary camera with dual pixel PDAF and OIS with an 83-degree field of view (FOV). The ultra-wide camera offers a 12-megapixel sensor with a 123-degree FOV. Selfies are handled by a 10-megapixel camera. \nThe phone's battery capacity also remains the same at 3,700mAh, along with 25W wired charging and 15W wireless charging as before. \nThe software is where things have changed, but primarily for the cover display. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 runs One UI 5.1.1 with Android 13. The Galaxy Z Flip 5's Flex Window is basically a bigger version of its previous display, but it comes with a lot of added functionality. \nAs observed from previous leaks, it is indeed a widget-based interface. There's a widget for most native apps, but I could not spot any from Google during my brief hands-on time. One can place calls from the call log widget, check the weather, and even reply to notifications with a full keyboard, which is a big leap from the previous implementation, which used voice input for sending out replies. \nThe cover display cannot run full apps like on the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra (Review) which seems like a big missed opportunity for Samsung, but we will reserve our final opinion for the full review. The Flex Window also has quick toggles (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc) and comes with Samsung Pay support. Samsung has also added the ability to show one's boarding pass at the airport from the outer display itself, thus reducing the need to open the phone. A neat trick which Samsung has included is Multi-Widget view, which basically uses the pinch gesture to give a zoomed-out view of all the active widgets in the cover display. \nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5's success depends heavily on the practicality of its new cover display and how frequently it reduces the need to unfold the main display. Our eyes are also on the new chipset which gives Samsung a natural edge in terms of performance over the competition, but we have to use it more to see if there is any improvement with imaging quality and battery life as well. There's more to come in the full review. ",

The actor, whose performance as the titular Rocky of Karan Johar's film has been singled out for praise, shared a throwback picture of himself in the gym, flexing impressive muscles. It's no ordinary flex either; Ranveer captioned the post with a line borrowed from the OG Rocky – boxer Rocky Balboa written and played by Sylvester Stallone. He wrote: "It's not about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward." – ROCKY," adding the Monday Motivation hashtag. \nThe comments thread is fully appreciative of this Rocky.  "Now that's a classic line," read a comment. "Those biceps have every right to do anything," read another. "It's Ranveer Singh's world and we're just living in it," read a third. The Cult Fit Instagram handle wrote, "We're in love with this Rocky aur fitness ki prem kahani." \nSome comments were Rocky-specific. "Rocky ki itni achhi English kaise ho gayi," one fan wanted to know – in Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, Ranveer Singh's character is a flashy young West Delhi man whose OTT style competes for attention with hilariously broken English. Another fan asked, "Why was your intro scene so drastically shortened?" (Editor's note – it was?) A third comment read, "What are you?" – in the film, Alia Bhatt, who plays Rani, asks Rocky more than once, "Tu kya hai?"`,

        "Ever wondered what 'baingan' is called in English? Some say brinjal, while chefs and food experts prefer aubergine, adding sophistication to this humble veggie. Others opt for eggplant, leaving us utterly perplexed with multiple names for the same veggie. Teaching kids the English names of veggies becomes even more challenging. But fear not, we'll take you on a journey to uncover the origins and history of this versatile vegetable and reveal the secrets behind its many names. Let's delve into the captivating story of baingan. \nWhat Makes Baingan A Popular Vegetable Across The Globe? \nBelieve it or not, baingan is considered exotic in the world of global gastronomy. In fact, according to some theories, it is also referred to as the 'king of vegetables' due to its rich purple colour and bulky texture, which also makes the vegetable a perfect veg substitute for various meat-based dishes. You will find baingan being widely used in countless recipes in Middle Eastern, Asian and some European countries including France and Italy. Alongside its culinary versatility, baingan is great for your health too. This powerhouse vegetable contains high amount of fibre, antioxidants, and minerals and is low in calories and sodium, making it a perfect ingredient to aid digestion, gut-health, weight loss, health blood pressure levels amongst others. \nWhat Is The Origin Of Baigan | Where Was It First Found: \nYou would be fascinated to know that baingan is considered a native to India. As per historians, somewhere around 5000 years ago, a group of people migrated from Southeast Asia to the Chota Nagpur Plateau and domesticated a spiny bitter fruit into a delicious vegetable and named it 'vartaku'. Food Historian KT Achaya, in his book named 'A Historical Dictionary Of Indian Food', explained that it was then called 'vatingana' in Sanskrit and later Bengal made it 'begun' for them and in Hindi it got the name 'baingan'. And that's how the vegetable got popularised across India. \n \nBrinjal Vs. Aubergine Vs. Eggplant: History Behind The English Names Of Baigan: \nWith popularity, the vegetable grabbed attention of the Buddhist monks who then went on travelling to the world along with the vegetable. According to multiple historical theories, it then went to Persia where baingan was named 'badinjan', and then the Arabs referred to it as 'al-badinjan'. The Arabs then took it to Spain where the Catalans named the vegetable 'al-berjinia'. It then became what we know as 'aubergine' in French. Eventually 'aubergine' became a part of the English terms and terminology. \nHowever, the Spanish people called the vegetable 'berenjena', which was then taken by the neighbouring country Portuguese, who named it 'beringela'. Finally, after touring the world, the mighty baingan again came back to India along with the Portuguese, where it finally got the name 'brinjal'. \nNow, you might be wondering, why is it called eggplant?! Well, that has quite a funny story to it! The white variety of the vegetable, which are somewhat round and small in shape, looked much like eggs hanging on tree. That's how it got popularised as eggplant, which now is majorly referred to the small-sized baingan.",

      image:
        "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-08/r5m2rev_stomach-growling_625x300_01_August_23.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=620,height=350",
      description:
        "One of the most embarrassing situations is experiencing a sudden, loud stomach growl at the most inconvenient times. Whether it happens during a crucial meeting, a quiet yoga class, or a romantic dinner, that rumbling sound can leave us feeling flustered and hoping that no one heard it. However, deep down, we know someone probably did. While a one-off incident is nothing to worry about, if it happens frequently, it's essential to address the issue to avoid embarrassment in the future. Here is a list of diet tips that can help silence those growls and maintain a healthy tummy. \nWhy Does Your Stomach Growl? \nWhen food, liquid, and gas pass through the stomach and small intestine together, it produces a rumbling sound in the stomach that can be felt and heard. This mostly occurs when the body is hungry or experiencing indigestion. Sometimes, excessive growling accompanied by pain, constipation, or diarrhoea may indicate serious health issues such as food allergies, infections, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which require medical intervention. However, for hunger and indigestion-related growling, the following tips can come in handy. \nHere Are 10 Diet Tips That Will Stop Your Stomach from Growling: \n1. Step Out After a Protein-Packed Breakfast: \nBreakfast is indeed the most important meal of the day, and opting for a protein-rich morning feast can work wonders in keeping your stomach satisfied. Proteins take longer to digest than carbohydrates, helping you stay full for an extended period. Start your day with eggs, moong dal chilla, or a smoothie blended with protein-rich ingredients like almond milk, chia seeds, and nut butter. Here are some other protein-rich breakfast dishes you can opt for. \n2. Include Fibre in Every Meal: \nFibre is a magical component when it comes to satiety. Foods high in fibre not only aid digestion but also keep your stomach feeling full. Incorporate whole grains like brown rice and oats into your meals, and don't forget a generous portion of fruits and vegetables. Not only do they add essential nutrients to your diet, but they also act as natural hunger tamers. \n3. Know When to Stop: \nIn a hurry, we often gobble down meals without paying attention to our body's signals. Practising mindful eating can help us recognize true hunger and prevent overeating. Chew your food slowly, savour each bite, and put your fork down between bites. \n4. Stay Hydrated: \nDehydration can often be mistaken for hunger, leading to unnecessary snacking and stomach growls. Always keep a water bottle handy and aim to drink at least eight glasses of water daily. You can also infuse water with fruits or herbs for added flavour, making hydration more enjoyable. \n5. Don't Skip Meals: \nSkipping meals might seem like an effective way to cut calories, but it can lead to excessive hunger and more significant stomach growls later on. Stick to regular meal times and enjoy balanced, nutritious meals to keep your energy levels steady throughout the day. \n6. Snack Smartly: \nSnacking can be a double-edged sword when it comes to preventing stomach growls. Opt for snacks that combine protein and fibre to keep you full until your next meal. Nuts, seeds, Greek yoghurt, and sliced fruits with nut butter are excellent choices. Avoid sugary and processed snacks, as they can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar, leading to sudden hunger pangs. Here are some fibre-rich snacks to add to your menu. \n7. Spice Up Your Meals: \nIncluding spicy ingredients in your meals can help curb hunger. Spices like chilli peppers contain capsaicin, which can temporarily reduce appetite and boost metabolism. Adding a touch of spice to your dishes can be a flavorful way to keep your stomach from growling. \n8. Plan Ahead: \nBeing prepared with healthy snacks and meals can prevent you from reaching for unhealthy options when hunger strikes. Plan your meals ahead of time, and pack nutritious snacks like carrot sticks, hummus, or trail mix when you're on the go. \n9. Get Enough Sleep: \nA good night's sleep prevents excessive hunger. Lack of sleep can disrupt the balance of hunger-regulating hormones, leading to increased cravings and stomach growls. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep every night to keep your appetite in check. \n10. Pick The Glass Of Water For Quick Relief \nWater comes as a saviour when your stomach starts acting up all of a sudden. Gulp down a glass or more of water for a quick-fix solution. You may find some relief when nothing else can be done. \nIncorporating these diet tips into your daily routine can lead to a happier, more contented stomach and a healthier relationship with food. So, muffle that growling sound and prevent those uncomfortable situations.",

        "The time of your workout can influence your workout in several ways. However, the extent to which it matters may vary depending on individual preferences and circumstances. Your body's energy levels can fluctuate throughout the day due to factors like circadian rhythms and sleep patterns. \nMany people find that they have higher energy levels and greater physical performance during certain parts of the day. Choosing a time when you feel most energetic can enhance your workout performance. Selecting a workout time that fits into your daily routine and is feasible for you to maintain consistently is crucial. \nIf you choose a time that frequently conflicts with your responsibilities or schedule, it may become difficult to stay consistent with your workouts. Consistency is key to achieving long-term fitness goals. In this article, we discuss how different times of the day can be beneficial for working out. \n7 Potential time slots that are considered good for working out: \n1. Early Morning (6-9 AM) \nThis time slot is often favored by people who enjoy starting their day with exercise. Working out in the morning can boost metabolism, provide energy for the day, and set a positive tone for the entire day ahead. \n2. Late Morning (10-11 AM) \nFor those who prefer a slightly later start, late morning is a good time to workout. By this time, the body is warmed up, flexibility is improved, and muscle strength is increased, reducing the risk of injury. \n3. Lunchtime (12-2 PM) \nSome people find it convenient to exercise during their lunch break. It can serve as a productive break from work, helping to alleviate stress and enhancing overall productivity for the rest of the day. \n4. Afternoon (3-5 PM) \nThis time slot can be suitable for individuals who naturally have higher energy levels during the afternoon. It could be a good time for high-intensity workouts or team sports, as body temperature tends to be higher, leading to better performance. \n5. Early Evening (5-7 PM) \nFor many people, early evening is a popular workout time. After the workday, it allows time to decompress and shake off the day's stress. Additionally, this time slot provides an opportunity to exercise with a partner or attend group fitness classes. \n6. Late Evening (7-9 PM) \nFor those who prefer a workout closer to bedtime, late evening can be a good option. However, it is recommended to allow some time (around an hour) between exercise and sleep to allow the body to cool down before bedtime. \n7. Night Owl (10 PM-Midnight) \nSome individuals find it suitable to exercise late at night. While this can be a good way to relieve stress and gain energy for night owls, it's important to ensure adequate sleep after completing the workout. \nUltimately, the best time to work out is whenever you can consistently adhere to a routine that suits your lifestyle, goals, and preferences. Listen to your body, experiment with different time slots, and find what works best for you in terms of energy levels, motivation, and schedule.",

        "Los Angeles: The Warner Bros. Film Group in the United States has issued a public apology about social media activity concerning the 'Barbenheimer' meme, which has caused outrage in Japan, Variety reported. \"Warner Brothers sincerely apologises for its recent insensitive social media engagement.\" \"The studio sincerely apologises,\" the firm wrote in an email to Variety on Tuesday. \nThis comes after public criticism of Warner in Japan, the launch of an online petition against the studio, and an unexpected step by Warner's Japanese distribution arm. \nWarner Bros. Japan issued a statement on its official Japanese-language Barbie Twitter account on Monday, criticising the studio's U.S. division for participating in the 'Barbenheimer' social media frenzy. \nThe Barbie US Twitter account has interacted with some fan posts regarding 'Barbenheimer,' which alludes to the simultaneous summer releases of Universal's Oppenheimer and Warner Bros.' Barbie. \nBoth films were released on July 21 in North America and many overseas regions and quickly became box office smashes. During their debuts, they helped propel the box office to its fourth highest-grossing weekend in history. \nOppenheimer has not yet been released in Japan, and no release date has been set. While the film debates the issue of whether bombings ultimately saved lives and brought world peace, the current clash highlights the enduring sensitivity of the nuclear weapons debate in Japan, as per Variety. \nAccording to some estimates, the two atomic bombs launched by the United States on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 killed as many as 250,000 people. \n\"We consider it extremely regrettable that the official account of the American headquarters for the movie 'Barbie' reacted to the social media postings of 'Barbenheimer' fans,\" Warner Bros. Japan wrote in a statement published on the 'Barbie' Japan Twitter profile. \"We take this situation very seriously. We are asking the U.S. headquarters to take appropriate action. We apologize to those who were offended by this series of inconsiderate reactions. Warner Bros Japan.\" \nIn response to one 'Barbenheimer' fan art poster depicting Margot Robbie's Barbie perched on Cillian Murphy's J. Robert Oppenheimer's shoulders in front of a flaming atomic mushroom cloud, the 'Barbie' U.S. Twitter account tweeted, \"It's going to be a summer to remember.\" Twitter, now known as X, updated the tweet with a community comment explaining the historical background of the mushroom cloud picture. \n\"At 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945 (Showa 20 Hiroshima for the first time in human history,\" the Twitter note reads. \"The particular nature of the damage caused by the atomic bombs is that mass destruction and mass murder occurred instantaneously and indiscriminately.\" \nIn Japan, the 'Barbenheimer' craze has drawn criticism for trivialising the horrific catastrophe wrought by atomic bombs. In recent days, the hashtag #NoBarbenheimer has been trending across the country.",

        'As a mushroom cloud of controversy threatens to overwhelm Oppenheimer\'s run in India, social media as always offers an insight into public opinion. A sex scene featuring a line from the Bhagavad Gita has caused official outrage with Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur pulling up the Censor Board for passing the scene and demanding it be deleted. The scene that has caused offence shows protagonist Robert Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, in an intimate moment with Jean Tatlock, played by Florence Pugh; she opens his copy of the Gita and asks him to read from which he does. \nThe line of scripture used in the scene is one that is famously associated with Robert Oppenheimer: "Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."  He is believed to have quoted it while watching the atom bomb he created detonate in a test. Exactly why director Christopher Nolan opted to use it in a sex scene in the film is unclear - there seems to be no good reason other than creative licence. \nOn Twitter, folks are mostly baffled, their outrage perhaps tempered perhaps by the reverence that Christopher Nolan commands among Indian fans. As a tweet points out, the filmmaker behind movies like Inception, Memento and the Dark Knight trilogy is not known for sex scenes. Some tweets called the placement of the Gita quote in a sex scene "awkward and avoidable" and "absolutely unnecessary." The general consensus is that this Nolan creative choice makes little sense. \nOver the weekend, Uday Mahurkar, Information Commissioner with the government of India shared this press release from the \'Save Culture Save India Foundation.\' \nOppenheimer, which has received glowing reviews from critics and will likely generate Oscar buzz, documents the making of the first nuclear weapons. In addition to Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh, the stacked cast features Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon. Oppenheimer opened last Friday and made over ₹ 48 crore in its first weekend in Indian cinemas.',

        'Paul Reubens, the US comic who became famous in the 1980s for playing eccentric man-child Pee-wee Herman, and later infamous for his arrest at an adult theater, has died aged 70. Reubens died Sunday after a six-year battle with cancer which he had not publicly disclosed, according to a statement on the actor\'s official social media accounts. "Last night we said farewell to Paul Reubens, an iconic American actor, comedian, writer and producer whose beloved character Pee-wee Herman delighted generations of children and adults with his positivity, whimsy and belief in the importance of kindness," it said. \n"Paul bravely and privately fought cancer for years with his trademark tenacity and wit." \nA Facebook post included a quotation posthumously attributed to Reubens. \n"Please accept my apology for not going public with what I\'ve been facing the last six years," he said. \nLate-night host Jimmy Kimmel led the tributes, calling Reubens "a brilliant and original comedian who made kids and their parents laugh at the same time." \n"He never forgot a birthday and shared his genuine delight for silliness with everyone he met. My family and I will miss him," he posted on social media. \nBorn in New York state in 1952, Reubens launched his career as a comedian in Los Angeles in the 1970s. He introduced his most famous bow-tie-wearing persona in a 1980 stage show called The Pee-wee Herman Show. The production was a hit and led to an HBO special the following year. In 1985, Reubens teamed up with director Tim Burton to bring his character to the big screen, starring in "Pee-wee\'s Big Adventure." "Pee-wee\'s Playhouse" became a US television sensation, running from 1986-1990, with Reubens staying in character during interviews throughout its duration. But in 1991, Reubens\' career was dramatically derailed after he was arrested at an adult theater in Florida, and pleaded no contest to indecent exposure. The scandal was widely covered, and Reubens largely disappeared from the public eye for several years.

        "Diabetes is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases. It occurs when our blood glucose is high. Having diabetes can increase one's risk of various other diseases. Hence, it is necessary to prevent as well as treat diabetes. \nIf you already have diabetes, it is not too late to take steps to treat it or even improve your blood sugar levels. There are various ways in which you can manage diabetes and reduce blood sugar levels. In this article, we share tips that will help manage your blood sugar levels. \n8 Tips that can help manage diabetes and reduce blood sugar levels: \n1. Manage your diet \nOne of the most effective ways to manage diabetes is to follow a healthy diet. Avoid sugary and processed foods, and focus on consuming whole, unprocessed foods that are rich in fibre. Incorporate plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats into your meals. Additionally, portion control is crucial to maintain stable blood sugar levels. \n2. Stay physically active \nRegular exercise is essential for managing diabetes. Engaging in aerobic activities like walking, jogging, swimming, or cycling can help improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar levels. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. \n3. Maintain a healthy weight \nLosing excess weight can significantly improve insulin sensitivity and help manage diabetes. Adopting a balanced diet and exercising regularly can lead to weight loss, resulting in better control of blood sugar levels. \n4. Limit carbohydrate intake \nCarbohydrates are converted into sugar during digestion and can cause spikes in blood glucose levels. Focus on consuming complex carbohydrates like whole grains and legumes rather than refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pastries, and sugary drinks. Monitor your carbohydrate intake and spread it evenly throughout the day to avoid drastic blood sugar fluctuations. \n5. Manage stress levels \nChronic stress can contribute to elevated blood sugar levels. Find healthy ways to cope with stress such as practicing mindfulness, yoga, deep breathing exercises, or engaging in hobbies that help you relax. Get enough sleep and prioritise self-care activities to reduce stress levels. \n6. Stay hydrated \nDrinking an adequate amount of water can help regulate blood sugar levels and promote overall health. Aim to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water per day and limit the consumption of sugary beverages. \n7. Quit smoking \nSmoking not only increases the risk of developing diabetes but also worsens its complications. If you smoke, consider seeking professional help to quit smoking and improve your overall health. \n8. Monitor blood sugar levels regularly \nRegular monitoring of blood sugar levels is vital for managing diabetes. Follow the recommended guidelines provided by your healthcare provider to check your blood sugar levels at home and keep a record of the results. This will help you track your progress and make necessary adjustments to your lifestyle. \nRemember lowering your blood sugar levels is a gradual process, and always consult with your healthcare provider before making any significant changes to your lifestyle or starting a new exercise regime.",

        "Jam, a staple in most households and a favourite among many is a delightful treat enjoyed on a daily basis. Kids particularly love it, often turning to jam when they're feeling a bit choosy about their meals. Whether spread on bread, roti, or paratha, it adds that extra touch of flavour. While the market offers a variety of jam brands in different flavours, the cost can add up over time. On the flip side, there are those who prefer the simplicity and affordability of homemade jam, avoiding the additives found in store-bought options. If you fall into this category and want to treat your family to homemade goodness, consider these foolproof tips for crafting the perfect jam right in your kitchen. \nHere's How To Whip Up Lip-smacking Homemade Jam In Minutes: \n1. Picking the Right Fruit \nAlthough jam can be made from a range of fruits, your choice significantly impacts the taste. It's crucial to avoid using overripe or damaged fruits. Always opt for fresh, ripe fruits that aren't too soft. If you're aiming for jam, slightly less ripe fruits are your best bet. \n2. Using the Right Sugar \nFor a better flavour, always go for granulated sugar when making jam. However, remember that the sugar needs to dissolve completely before the mixture boils. Failing to do so might result in a grainy texture, so be patient and ensure proper dissolution. \n3.Getting Your Jars Ready \nProperly preparing your jars is essential to maintain the taste of your jam. Wash your glass jars thoroughly with warm, soapy water and make sure they're completely dry. To be extra cautious, give them a wipe-down or leave them in the sun for a bit. \n4.Dealing with Consistency Issues \nSometimes, your homemade jam might not have the thickness you're aiming for, unlike store-bought varieties. If you encounter this issue, here are some easy solutions. \n5. Give it Another Cook \nWhen your jam turns out thinner than you'd like, simply put it back in the pot and gently heat it again until it thickens. Just remember to keep stirring to prevent sticking. \n6.Let it Set \nAfter cooking, you might find your jam is a bit runny. Don't fret - it might thicken as it cools down. You can leave the jam at room temperature or pop it in the fridge for a few hours to achieve the desired consistency. \nWith these simple yet effective tips, you're all set to create a homemade jam that's as delicious and satisfying as store-bought versions. Enjoy the process and relish the taste of your very own concoction.",

        "As we age, we experience a slow-down in vitality, sex drive, energy levels and face age related issues such as fatigue, joint pain, wrinkles, hair-loss, reduced mental and cognitive function etc. Here are some of the science-backed pathways that will help us turn the clock backwards, look, feel and perform better. \n1. Optimise nutrient intake: Micronutrients such as Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, and iron levels are very important nutrients that you should take in sufficient amount for the proper functioning of your body. The normal level of vitamin B12 in your bloodstream lies between 190 and 950 (pg/mL). However, for having an ideal vitality and performance level, vitamin b12 range should be above 700 (pg/mL). \n2. Maintain hormone balance: The balance of key hormones such as Testosterone, Cortisol, DHEA is important to improve your vitality. Our body drops 1-3% hormones every year after the age of 30 and it accelerates due to unmanageable stress. Testosterone is responsible for the sex drive, and muscle gain which further improves through strength training. Recovery through deep sleep promotes serotonin hormone that helps with mood regulation and feeling of well-being. \n3. Shift to an active lifestyle: Having a healthy and active lifestyle can boost up your vitality and energy level to a next level. Make sure that you take a protein-first diet, develop strength training routine, and improve core-strength or posture through yoga to reduce the chances of sexual dysfunction. Moreover, smoking, excessive consumption of alcohol, obesity and diabetes can also reduce your vitality. \n4. Develop a positive mindset: Stress is inevitable and sometimes moderate stress is good and keeps us motivated. A better mindset and good self-esteem promotes feeling of confidence and vitality. Surrounding yourself around positive people, and meditating for at least half an hour can help you enhance and increase your vitality. \n5. Improve circulation and reduce inflammation: The antioxidants such as vitamin A, E, and omega 3 fatty acids can boost circulation and reduce inflammation and promote cell repair. Poor circulation can lead to cardiac conditions and also erectile dysfunction where the blood flow is impaired. Exercise is an excellent way to increase your overall circulation. ",

        'Fans are loving Akshay Kumar and Pankaj Tripathi\'s camaraderie in OMG 2. The Amit Rai directorial, despite tough competition from Gadar 2 and Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, outshined its opening day performance on day 2. According to film analyst Taran Adarsh, the movie\'s success story has been attributed to positive "word-of-mouth" reviews. OMG 2 minted ₹ 15.30 crore on the second day of its release. The total two-day collection resulted in over ₹ 25. crore earnings for the movie in just two days. Taran Adarsh wrote, "The glowing word of mouth has come into play… #OMG2, as predicted, shows excellent growth on Day 2… The solid gains at national chains - despite #Gadar2 juggernaut - is a clear indicator that #OMG2 has found acceptance… Fri 10.26 cr, Sat 15.30 cr. Total: ₹ 25.56 cr. #India biz." \nThe Akshay Kumar and Pankaj Tripathi-starrer collected over ₹ 10 crore on the first day of its release. According to Taran Adarsh, though the numbers were "severely impacted" by the Gadar 2 wave, OMG 2 fares were "better than expected." On the film\'s day 1 box office collection, the trade analyst wrote, “#OMG2 is heavily dependent on word of mouth and this factor will decide where it lands in the coming days… The #IndependenceDay holiday [on Tue] will certainly boost its biz, but it needs to sustain beyond the big holiday to establish itself.” \nOMG 2 received mixed reactions from critics and audiences alike. In his review for NDTV, film critic Saibal Chatterjee gave the film 2 stars out of 5. He wrote, "God\'s messenger in OMG is embodied by a flamboyant Akshay Kumar. The star\'s presence in the film is understandable. It enhances the box-office potential of the venture. But why Kanti Sharan Mudgal would need divine intervention to sort out his and his son\'s everyday problems in the real world is never clearly and convincingly established." \nOMG 2 is a satirical comedy-drama film. Along with Akshay Kumar and Pankaj Tripathi, the film also stars Yami Gautam. \nMeanwhile, Akshay Kumar will be next seen in The Great Indian Rescue and Gorkha.  Pankaj Tripathi has Metro In Dino, co-starring Anupam Kher and Neena Gupta, in the pipeline. He will also feature in Mai Atal Hoon and Fukrey 3.',

        "New Delhi: \"She's amazing, we hit it from the get go,\" says Hollywood star Gal Gadot, describing her bond with actor Alia Bhatt on the sets of their upcoming action-thriller Heart of Stone. Gal Gadot, who has also produced the movie, said she found that they both share a lot during her interactions with the Indian star, who makes her Hollywood debut with the Netflix film. \"She's amazing, we hit it from the get go. I think we share so much in common for the fact that I'm from Israel and she's from India. We're both now making this film that is global and American. \n\"And we're both very dedicated and hard workers in what we do, but we also are very family oriented... It was like the smoothest getting into a relationship I've had,\" Gadot told PTI in a group interview. \nHeart Of Stone follows Gal Gadot's Rachel Stone, a member of an elusive and mysterious group of elite spies called the Charter. \nWhen the shadowy organisation's cutting-edge weapon, an AI-esque technological core called the Heart, is stolen by hacker Keya Dhawan (Bhatt), Stone embarks on a globetrotting adventure to prevent the weapon from falling into the wrong hands and saving the day. \nGal Gadot said she enjoyed exploring the complex dynamic between the two main characters in the Tom Harper directorial that pits the two actors against each other. \nOnce you have a partner that you can trust, you enjoy the push and pull between the characters, it gives you a fight that has a weight. And you know that she's not faking and she's affected in the right way from me and vice versa. \n\"It's just delicious. It's a delightful way to work. And I definitely had that with Alia,\" she added. \nThe 38-year-old actor, most famous for her role of superhero Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman in many DC-Warner Bros movies, described her Heart of Stone character as a person of \"many contradictions\". \nI enjoyed playing this character so much. She's a character of many contradictions. On one hand, she thrives on adrenaline. She likes the mission. She's an incredible secret agent \n\"But at the same time, she's a loose cannon. She's having a hard time working within the system and following the rules. She's wild and she's not allowed to engage with people. And one thing she really wants is to engage with people and have these human connections in her life.\" Gal Gadot said she's a lot like Stone in real life. \n\"I think that the thing that really guided her was her instincts and the fact that she needs to follow her heart, literally, and listen to her guts. And that's something I try to do in my own life as well,\" she added. \nIn the film, the cornerstone of the Charter is its cutting-edge weapon called the Heart, a powerful AI which the organisation uses to tackle potential global threats and even find out the odds on the success in neutralising them. The AI keeps track of people's entire online history, thus empowering it to even predict the future. \nHollywood is no stranger to the theme of artificial intelligence and how it has the ability to change the course of the world. \nThe genre is populated by films like Terminator franchise, Steven Spielberg's \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\", Will Smith's I, Robot, Keanu Reeves-led The Matrix series and even lower-budget films like Ex Machina\" and Her. \nBut with the discourse around AI now hitting the headlines on a day-to-day basis, Heart of Stone, just like Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise's latest Mission: Impossible film Dead Reckoning Part One, feels timely. \nAnd even Gadot agrees. \"When we started to conceptualize the film, we spoke to professional people that come from this industry and what makes sense for the Charter and what makes sense for the heart and how it operates and what's real and what's not and how it should look like. \n\"And we knew that everyone was talking about AI for the past many years, but we never anticipated that once the movie is going to come out, it's going to be the hottest subject,\" the actor said. \nOn a personal level, Gal Gadot is fascinated and curious about AI and its potential but the actor said she is also afraid of it. \"When you hear people like the CEO of ChatGPT talking about the need for regulations and how responsible we have to be with it, we really need to take this seriously sooner rather than later,\" she added. \nHeart of Stone, which also stars Jamie Dornan, Sophie Okonedo and Matthias Schweighofer, will debut on Netflix on Friday. \nThe film has a screenplay by Greg Rucka and Allison Schroeder, and is produced by Gadot, David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, Don Granger, Jaron Varsano, Bonnie Curtis and Julie Lynn.",

        "Fire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra Review: Got the Looks, but What About the Rest?",

        "In a sea of budget smartwatches, Fire-Boltt's Phoenix Ultra stands out. This is mainly because of two factors — its price and design. The smartwatch is currently available in India at Rs. 2,199 makes it one of the most affordable smartwatches to sport a classic watch design and metal body, which feels familiar and appears more like a traditional timepiece than a smartwatch. I was a bit excited to see how it was possible to deliver such a device at this price point, but after a couple of weeks of use, I think know how it pulled it off. \nFire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra price, design and specifications \nThe Fire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra is currently available in single option which is officially priced at Rs. 2,999, but can be purchased for as low as Rs. 2,199 from online retailers. Fire-Boltt provides the smartwatch with a silicon strap, an extra magnetic metal loop strap, and a two-pin magnetic charger in the box. \nThe smartwatch is available in three case finishes – steel, black and gold. These finishes come with various strap combinations in the box. I received the steel finished case with a magnetic blue metal strap and soft grey silicone strap. \nAt a glance, the steel finish of the 44mm case sure looks classy and very similar to traditional timepieces. For an entry-level smartwatch, the finish of this metal case is surprisingly good and devoid of any sharp or rough edges. The back of the case is made of plastic with the sensor laid out dead-centre and the metal charging contacts closer to the edge above it. The Fire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra weighs 55g without the strap and also has an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. \nThe Fire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra with both metal and silicon straps is quite comfortable and does not feel heavy. The 22mm silicone strap has a quick release mechanism for attaching itself to the case. The metal loop strap has a strong magnet to hold the watch in place. During the review period, the watch never came undone no matter which strap I used. \nThe Fire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra has a rather basic 1.39 inches LCD display with a resolution of 240 × 240 pixels and a standard 60Hz refresh rate. It is surrounded by some really chunky bezels and the display in my unit seemed misaligned as the bottom bezel was a lot thicker than the rest. \nThe smartwatch has only one button and pressing it either wakes the display and shows the watch face or turns the display off. If you are in any other menu or app in the watch interface, pressing the button gets you back to the watch face directly. \nFire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra software and performance \nThe Fire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra offers a very basic software interface. While it lacks any support for third-party apps, even the basics aren't covered here. For example, there's no way to set the display timeout on the watch, which is set to five seconds by default. There's no basic calculator app either. I could not even check the charging status of the watch. \nThe Fire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra needs to be disconnected from the charger in order to view the watch face, which is the only place that displays the battery status. Setting an alarm, timer or stopwatch requires one to enter the settings menu, which is a layer down from the main menu. \nNavigating this simple software interface is quite easy using swipe gestures, which is why the usefulness of the crown is reduced to simply powering the display on or off as the flick-to-wake gesture also works just fine. \nMoving to the companion app, it's as basic as the smartwatch's UI and is available for both iOS and Android smartphones. The Da Fit app has three main sections — Today, device settings and My (which is basically the user's profile). Setting up the app using an Android smartphone was a fairly easy experience, its just that you have to keep the app locked in the phone's Recents menu to keep receiving notifications on the watch. \nThe Today page display's readings from the Fire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra which includes step count, sleep, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, along with exercise records. The device settings section lets you change the watch face, adjust notifications, set alarms etc. There is an important section called Others buried deep in here that let me set the time format, unit system, DnD timings, continuous heart rate setting intervals, and most important of all, the auto-lock or display sleep setting, which is not accessible on the watch. \nOne can use GPS connected exercises like outdoor runs or walks only via the Da Fit mobile app as the Fire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra does not have built-in GPS. What I did find odd is that the watch will never sync data to the app unless you enter the mobile app and swipe down to refresh the data in the Today section. \nThe watch face gallery has a handful of preinstalled watch faces (including one of Mahendra Singh Dhoni), but opening up the online gallery using the mobile app gave me access to plenty more downloadable ones, which appeared a lot more interesting. However, I did not manage to download and install a watch face even though these were barely 159kb in size. During this time, neither smartwatch nor the app is accessible, which can get frustrating. \nNotifications from the smartwatch are truncated. But it's hard to tell which app they're coming from as there is no clear iconography to indicate the same. Setting a timer on the smartphone will also push constant notifications for each passing second, filling up the notifications menu on the smartwatch. \nHealth tracking is another reason why most users go in for a smartwatch these days. Sadly my experience with the Fire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra was far from great. To begin with the watch only offers two automated health monitoring features. The first one is sleep monitoring, which attempts to deliver detailed sleep stage data or reports like deep sleep, light sleep, REM sleep and more. \nHowever, I found this data to be far from accurate as the watch often counted my time resting in bed (before falling asleep) as time spent sleeping due to which the resulting data turned out inaccurate. Continuous heart rate monitoring was another automated health-tracking feature and it is customisable letting you choose the interval. \nRegular heart rate measurements were inaccurate, inconsistent and quite unreliable when compared to the measurements provided by a standalone oximeter. SpO2 readings were a bit more reliable but still not consistent. \nThe Fire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra offers up to 123 fitness tracking sport modes. I tried out the basic step tracking feature using the Walking exercise mode and the watch managed to detect 505 instead of 500 steps, which seemed fine for a smartwatch at this price point. However, this is not a smartwatch I would choose for health and fitness tracking. \nThe Bluetooth calling feature works as expected and setting up the feature did not require me to pair the watch twice with the Android smartphone either. The caller could be heard loud and clear and wasn't able to tell that I was calling from a smartwatch. \nIn terms of battery life, I found that the Fire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra could deliver on its claimed battery life of seven days. This is possible mainly because the watch barely offers any auto-health tracking features since a majority of them have to be activated manually. Even data syncing does not take place automatically. Day to day battery drain was around 15-20 percent which included one short workout routine and sleep tracking. The automated heart rate monitoring, despite throwing up a warning, did not seem to affect battery life drastically provided I set it to 30 minute intervals. Charging the Fire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra does take a while. When connected to a 33W charger, it took around two hours. \nVerdict \nIt is difficult to beat the Fire-Boltt Phoenix Ultra when it comes to looks at this price, and that is sadly the only reason why could consider one. For everything else, there are much better options in the market.",

        "Alia also said that her first audition was for the movie Black \nDid you know Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor's first meeting was on the sets of the film Black? In a recent interview, for the promotion of her film Heart Of Stone, Alia talked about her “favourite firsts.” From her first film with Sanjay Leela Bhansali to her first choreography at the age of 4, the actress shared all the details. Alia said that her first audition was for the movie Black, headlined by Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukerji. In addition, the actress revealed that she met her now-husband, Ranbir Kapoor for the first time, on the sets of the 2005 film. Alia told Netflix, “I was auditioning for a young Rani Mukerji. I didn't get it obviously because I am not in the film. But fun fact it was the first time I also met my now husband (Ranbir Kapoor).” \nDuring the interview, the actress also shared the difference between a Hollywood film and shooting for Hindi cinema or Indian cinema. According to Alia, the energy on the sets, all around the world is the same. Everyone is working towards one vision, one mission and that is “to get the work right.” \nSome other favourite firsts of Alia Bhatt included her first movie Sangharsh, which was shot back when she was merely 5 or 6, and her first film with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Gangubai Kathiawadi. \nAlia Bhatt's Hollywood debut Heart Of Stone is streaming on the OTT giant, Netflix. The film, which also stars Gal Gadot and Jamie Dornan, opened to mixed reviews from both critics and audience alike. \nIn another interview, Alia Bhatt revealed that her Heart Of Stone co-star Gal Gadot was one of the first people to know about her pregnancy. In an interaction with  BBC Asia Network, Alia Bhatt said: \"I felt very protected and comfortable. You don't really talk about being pregnant until you are way into your first trimester; so I was not telling many people. But I did confide in Gal Gadot, I did confide in my producers and the director (Tom Harper) because they had to know. They were all so lovely and supportive and excited that I never for once doubted it at all.\" \nAlia Bhatt added, In fact, I remember we were once shooting, I am not going to talk much about it, but it was really hot and Gal was really bothered about my hydration and she was telling me to keep myself hydrated, asking me to drink enough water. She'd say, 'You need to keep yourself hydrated'. So, that's the kind of person she is and she exudes warmth and she is also extremely caring about everybody on her crew and she is wonderful with her actors as well. So yes, I felt too comfortable.\"",

        "Quitting smoking isn't easy, and it won't happen overnight, but the process isn't impossible. The journey will be challenging but will undoubtedly be rewarding once you enjoy the benefits of a smoke-free life. \n'Giving up smoking is the easiest thing to do. I've done it several times.' Today, it's impossible to be unaware of the problems associated with smoking. Every smoker knows the risks of heart ailments, cancer, stroke, and a plethora of other issues. However, despite this, quitting smoking is something that every smoker struggles with. Whether it's that one cigarette after work, or the other with your friends, the damage is done, and you have introduced your body to nicotine. \nAnd therein lies the biggest concern. Nicotine creates those cravings despite your brain being constantly aware of why you shouldn't smoke. Most people who try and fail to quit have similar reports like I am too stressed, I need it when I'm socialising or I can't function after lunch without my cigarette \nThese 'reasons' are in actuality the manifestation of your nicotine addiction. As soon as you attempt to quit smoking, nicotine withdrawal symptoms such as cravings, irritability, anger, insomnia, hunger, or restlessness start kicking in. Nicotine creates an urge that you can't resist leading you back to your old habits. So is there a way to fight the urge to smoke cigarettes? \nNicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT): The ideal solution to help you quit \nIf you are looking for a non-intrusive, seamless method to combat cravings and kick the habit, then NRTs are your best bet. Most people know of the nicotine gums, but they lack 100% effectiveness since they require the user to chew constantly which is not possible in every social setting. Moreover, gums do not sustain you through the day, and leave a lot of potential gaps for the vulnerable smoker to fall into, especially if they are heavy smokers. \nA great alternative, and one that is constructed to afford round the clock support against nicotine cravings and withdrawal, is the nicotine patch. Simply put, a nicotine patch is a transdermal patch that releases nicotine in a measured dose through your skin, into your bloodstream and then to your brain. This nicotine delivered from the patch replaces the nicotine smokers are used to getting from their cigarettes. This means that they can stop smoking, without dealing with the intense physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms of giving up on cigarettes. \nA nicotine patch regulates nicotine flow in one's body and provides a steady, sustained, and controlled nicotine flow throughout the day. While you continue to get a regular streamlined dose of the nicotine your body needs, you're also not exposed to tobacco's harmful effects, thereby making it one of the safest and reliable methods of quitting smoking. \nThe nicotine patch strength is decreased over time to let the user wean themselves off nicotine gradually. The nicotine patch therapy also prevents cravings through its 24-hr Smart Release Technology, which releases a measured dose of nicotine throughout the day. \nDosage and usage \nA nicotine patch should be applied on a body part that is dry, clean and hairless, recommended areas are the upper chest, upper arm or back. Apply one patch on daily basis and change the application sites every day. It comes in different dosage strengths ranging from 7mg, 14mg, to 21mg. One can choose the starting strength depending on the no. of cigarettes they smoke per day. If you smoke over 20 cigarettes a day, start with the 21mg nicotine patch and if you smoke less that 20 cigarettes, start with the 14mg nicotine patch. \nNicotine patch with a holistic lifestyle \nAlthough nicotine replacement therapy works effectively to reduce the urge to smoke, it is best to avoid smoking triggers. One of the best ways is to adopt a holistic lifestyle. Switch to a daily exercise regime and a nutritious diet, start pursuing hobbies that interest you and use your time productively. \nQuitting isn't easy, and it won't happen overnight, but the process isn't impossible. The journey will be challenging but will undoubtedly be rewarding once you enjoy the benefits of a smoke-free life.",

        '"The refusal to take writers\' reasonable proposals seriously has caused the WGA strike to last 100 days and counting; it serves only as a milestone of shame", the WGA told AFP \nLos Angeles: Hollywood writers marked the 100th day of their industry-crippling strike Wednesday, dubbing the occasion a "milestone of shame" for studios as the two sides remain deadlocked. Since early May, the Writers Guild of America walkout has brought countless film shoots and productions to a halt, costing the California economy millions of dollars each day, but the two sides have barely spoken. \nThe chaos wrought on the entertainment industry only deepened last month, when writers were joined on the picket lines by the far larger Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA). \n"The refusal to take writers\' reasonable proposals seriously has caused the WGA strike to last 100 days and counting; it serves only as a milestone of shame" for the studios, the WGA told AFP. \nThe studios "are wholly responsible for the over three-month shutdown of the industry and the pain it has caused workers and all others whose livelihoods depend on this business," said a union statement. \nWriters and actors are demanding better pay and residuals, guarantees over the future use of artificial intelligence, and other working conditions. \n"The cost of settling the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes is far less than the damage their intractability has caused," said the WGA statement. \nCoincidentally, the last WGA strike, in 2007-08, was resolved after exactly 100 days. \nThat stoppage cost $2.1 billion to the California economy, according to one estimate by the Milken Institute. \nThis time, there is no apparent end in sight.Writers and studios tentatively gathered last Friday to discuss formally reopening talks for the first time since May, but the sitdown has not yielded any tangible results. \nHours before they even met, a WGA missive to members expressed skepticism about the studios\' good faith. The studios hit back with a terse statement calling the writers\' rhetoric "unfortunate." \nDisney \'committed\' \nWriters say studios have been methodically eroding their salaries for years, making it impossible for all but the very top ranks to earn a living. \nThey contend that the rise of streaming platforms - who do not generally reveal viewing figures - has deprived them of giant paydays when they create global hits. \nOn the picket line outside Netflix\'s offices Wednesday, screenwriter Charlie Kesslering said the strike is an "existential fight." \n"This is about the careers that we love so much remaining careers, and remaining viable as a way to make a living -- especially in an expensive city like Los Angeles, where you have to live if you want a career in this business," he told AFP. \n"It\'s going to take a lot more than 100 days for the motivation to go away." \nAlso on Wednesday, Disney CEO Bob Iger told investors on an earnings call that he was "personally committed" to finding "solutions to the issues that have kept us apart these past few months." \nIger has become a focus of anger for strikers, after giving an interview last month in which he called their walkout "disturbing" and "not realistic." \nAdopting a more conciliatory note Wednesday, Iger expressed "deep respect and appreciation for all those who are vital to the extraordinary creative engine that drives this company, and our industry." \nBut in its statement, the WGA warned: "Ultimately, the studios have no choice but to make a fair deal." \n"Until then, we remain resolved and united."',

        "Kathi rolls are one of the most beloved street foods in India. In your city, you're bound to stumble upon several stalls selling a variety of kathi rolls. Bursting with flavours and perfect for on-the-go munching, these rolls have earned a reputation for being both satisfying and wholesome. It's no wonder people seize every opportunity to indulge in one. Many of us try our hand at making them at home. Yet, more often than not, we fall short of replicating the same flavour and texture of street stalls. Is there a secret masala that they use for their stuffing, or is it some unique technique that we're missing out on? Well, the truth is not as complicated as it may seem. With a few simple steps, a bit of attention, and you'll be able to make authentic kathi rolls with ease in your own kitchen. \nHere Are 5 Tips To Make Street-Style Kathi Roll At Home: \n1. Use the right type of bread: \nThe type of bread you use to make the roll makes all the difference. After all, it's what helps keep all the stuffing intact. Stick to using a paratha, as it gives the kathi roll a perfectly crispy and flaky texture. You can even scramble an egg on top of it for authentic street-style flavours. If you prefer a softer texture, you can even use roomali roti. \n2. It's all about the marination: \nKathi rolls can be stuffed with a myriad of different fillings. Be it veggies or meat, make sure to marinate all of it well. Blend them nicely with all the masalas and allow enough time for them to sit. The longer you allow the filling to sit, the better it'll absorb all the flavours, ensuring a burst of flavour in every bite. \n3. Set the right heat: \nWhile eating kathi rolls on the street, you must've noticed vendors cooking the marinated stuffing in a large wok on a high flame. This helps give it a distinct taste and a slightly charred flavour. It may take a bit of practice, but using a high flame is best for recreating street-style flavours. However, be careful not to burn it. \n4. Add a generous amount of chutney: \nThe yummy chutneys inside a kathi roll are what makes it taste so delicious. The chutneys add moistness and a burst of flavour. Classic pudina chutney is the most preferred chutney that is used inside kathi rolls. You can even add some sweet chutney to balance out the spiciness. Whatever your choice may be, make sure to always add a generous amount of it! \n5. Wrap it the right way: \nKathi rolls taste good only when the stuffing is evenly spread inside them. No one likes to bite into a roll that feels empty on one side and overstuffed on the other. To ensure everything stays in place, it's important to wrap it the right way. Place a generous amount of stuffing in the centre and fold it over nicely. Secure it with a toothpick for better protection. \nMaking street-style kathi rolls is not as difficult as it seems. Just be mindful of the above-mentioned tips, and you'll be able to recreate authentic flavours in your kitchen. ",

        "A sleep schedule, also known as a sleep routine or sleep pattern, is a planned schedule that determines when an individual goes to bed and wakes up. It typically involves setting consistent sleep and wake-up times. A consistent sleep cycle poses very beneficial for the body. \nHaving a stable sleep schedule is generally considered good for health. Adequate and consistent sleep is crucial for optimal daytime functionality. With a sleep schedule, individuals are more likely to feel well-rested, focused, and have better cognitive functioning throughout the day. Keep reading as we discuss some of the many benefits of sleeping on a designated time and following a sleep schedule. \n7 Reasons why you should have a designated sleep cycle: \n1. Better sleep quality \nEstablishing a regular sleep routine helps synchronise the body's internal clock, known as the circadian rhythm. This allows individuals to fall asleep faster and experience deeper, more restorative sleep. Following a sleep schedule helps regulate your body's internal clock, allowing you to fall asleep and wake up at consistent times. This can lead to improved sleep quality, making you feel more refreshed and energised during the day. \n2. Improved productivity \nHaving a consistent sleep schedule helps you establish a routine, making it easier to plan and prioritise your day. When you consistently get enough rest, you're more likely to be alert, focused, and productive throughout the day. \n3. Enhanced mental health \nAdequate sleep is essential for maintaining good mental health. Following a sleep schedule can help regulate your emotions, reduce stress, and improve your overall well-being. Sleep deprivation and irregular sleep patterns have been linked to increased risk of mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. Maintaining a sleep schedule can contribute to improved mental well-being. \n4. Increased energy levels \nWhen you follow a sleep schedule, your body gets accustomed to a routine, making it easier to wake up feeling refreshed and energised. Consistent sleep patterns can provide you with the energy you need to tackle the day's challenges. \n5. Boosted immune system \nQuality sleep is crucial for a strong immune system. By following a sleep schedule and consistently getting enough rest, you give your body the chance to repair and regenerate, helping to strengthen your immune system and ward off illnesses. \n6. Healthier weight management \nStudies have shown that irregular sleep patterns and lack of quality sleep can contribute to weight gain. By following a sleep schedule, you can help regulate your metabolism and reduce the likelihood of overeating or craving unhealthy foods. \n7. Reduced risk of chronic conditions \nConsistently getting enough sleep and following a sleep schedule can help reduce the risk of developing chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Quality sleep is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being. \nIt's important to note that individual sleep needs can vary. While most adults require around 7-9 hours of sleep per night, some may need more or less. Finding the right sleep schedule that suits your personal needs and lifestyle is essential for reaping the benefits of a consistent sleep routine.",

        "The Poco Pods don’t offer much, but they don’t cost much either. \nSmartphone brands entering the accessories space is not a new thing, and many such as Xiaomi, Oppo, OnePlus, Samsung, and Apple have established product ranges in the true wireless audio segment. The latest to give it a shot is Poco, which operates in India as a sub-brand of Xiaomi, and has been a noteworthy player in the mid-range smartphone segment. The company's first audio product is firmly an entry-level offering. \nPriced at Rs. 1,199 in India, the Poco Pods true wireless earphones isn't too complex or feature-rich, but they don't cost a lot either. This headset is as basic as it gets, but perhaps that's exactly what some might need. Find out if the Poco Pods is indeed worth the price, and if it's the best affordable true wireless headset you can buy right now. \nPoco Pods design, features, and specifications \nThe Poco Pods headset has what I consider a very generic look and feel (it looks a lot like the Redmi Buds 4 Active), but this isn't a bad thing. The earpieces are light and fairly durable, with a proper in-canal fit and stem design. The headset is available in a single black-and-yellow colour option — Poco's signature colour scheme. If that wasn't enough, the large Poco logo on the front of the all-black charging case sufficiently makes the point. \nThe earpieces have touch-sensitive areas for controls, but the lack of app support on the Poco Pods means that the controls are fixed and non-customisable. A double-tap gesture will let you answer calls or play and pause music, while a triple tap on either side cancel the call or skip to the next track. You can't skip to the previous track from the earphones; you'll need the paired smartphone to do that. \nA long press on both earpieces simultaneously will activate or disable the low-latency mode. There are a couple of other gestures meant to put the headset into forced pairing mode or factory reset the Poco Pods, but you can simply put the earphones into pairing mode by disconnecting all other connected and paired devices. On the whole, the system functions are fairly easy and uncomplicated, as you'd expect from a true wireless headset which doesn't have app support. \nThe charging case has a small indicator light at the bottom, alongside the USB Type-C charging port. The fit on the earpieces is decent, and the Poco Pods come with environmental noise cancellation, which promises better performance on calls. The sales package includes a total of three pairs of silicone ear tips of different sizes, but no charging cable is included in the box. \nAs mentioned earlier, there is no app support on the Poco Pods, but I wouldn't go as far as to call this a drawback on a headset in this price range. Fortunately, you do get the basics such as USB Type-C charging, as well as the benefits of features such as environmental noise cancellation and 60ms low-latency for use when gaming. \nThe Poco Pods headset has 12mm dynamic drivers, and uses Bluetooth 5.3 for connectivity, with support for only the SBC Bluetooth codec — a disappointing spec even at this price. Usefully, either earpiece can be used individually if you like, with the other securely stored in the charging case and not affecting stable connectivity for the earpiece in operation. \nPoco Pods performance and battery life \nI tend to keep my expectations tempered when it comes to affordable true wireless earphones; you're paying almost entirely for the form factor here, and saving on paying premiums for the ‘fluff', so to speak. The Poco Pods largely deliver that straightforward true wireless experience, but the sound quality is perhaps not as good as it could have been, even considering the affordable pricing. \nDetailed tuning might be too much to expect here, but the crux of the Poco Pods' shortcomings can be pinned on its codec limitations. The SBC codec doesn't quite allow enough bandwidth for the earphones to work with, and this can be heard in the sound quality. It sounds unrefined at times, although it doesn't reach a point of being unpleasant even at high volumes. It's listenable considering the price, and useful if you just need earphones to help you tune out your surroundings. \nStarting with David Guetta's Stay (Don't Go Away), the sound initially sounded alright when the track itself wasn't pushing too hard, but as the attack picked up, the Poco Pods started to sound a bit muffled. I wouldn't go as far as to call it muddy or too harsh, and the sound might even appeal to those who enjoy hearing a bit more from the bass frequencies. \nCertain genres and types of tracks are admittedly better suited to this kind of tuning and sound, with many of Croatia Squad's distinctly beat-driven tracks sounding rather enjoyable on the Poco Pods. The progressive and rather straightforward attack of Make Your Move by Croatia Squad was perhaps the best example of how a niche (or genre, in this case) can be found to bring the best out of even affordable wireless earphones. The lack of detail in the track was evident, but matters less with certain tracks and genres such as this. \nCall quality is acceptable and workable enough for both indoor and outdoor use; microphone performance is decent in quiet rooms, but suffered a bit outdoors despite the presence of ENC. Low-latency mode didn't seem to make much of a difference in audio latency on basic mobile games. \nBattery life is decent on the Poco Pods, with the earphones running for around five hours on a single charge of the earpieces, and the charging case offering over three full additional charges, for a total run time of around 22-23 hours per charge cycle, which is a bit lower than the claimed time of 30 hours. This is somewhat expected given the lack of features and codec support, but users will obviously find this good enough for practical all-day listening. \nVerdict \nThe Poco Pods true wireless headset delivers largely what you expect from a headset in this price range — nothing more, and nothing less. The earphones are basic, but reasonably well set up for the kind of music that most budget buyers might want to listen to. Don't expect too much detail, and use these for casual listening, particularly when out and about thanks to the decent passive noise isolation. Battery life is decent as well. \nThere is plenty of competition in this price segment, but Poco's first effort in the true wireless audio space is a commendable effort. Perhaps the only real drawback is the lack of support for the AAC Bluetooth codec, but all things considered this is a worthwhile pair of earphones if you have a very tight budget.",

        "Los Angeles: Hollywood star Sandra Bullock's longtime partner Bryan Randall has died after a three-year private battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He was 57. \nIn a statement, the model-turned-photographer's family said Randall passed away \"peacefully\" on August 5. \"Bryan chose early to keep his journey with ALS private and those of us who cared for him did our best to honour his request.\" \n\"We are immensely grateful to the tireless doctors who navigated the landscape of this illness with us and to the astounding nurses who became our roommates, often sacrificing their own families to be with ours,\" the statement read. \nRandall's family further asked for \"privacy to grieve and to come to terms with the impossibility of saying goodbye to Bryan\". ALS is a rare disease that attacks and kills the nerve cells that control voluntary muscles. \nAccording to People magazine, Bullock, 59, met Randall when he was hired to capture her son Louis' birthday party in 2015. They went public with their relationship later that year by making an appearance at Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's wedding. \nBullock, who is mother to two adopted children -- Louis, 13, and daughter Laila, 10, had talked about her relationship with Randall during a 2021 appearance on Facebook Watch's Red Table Talk opposite Jada Pinkett Smith. \n\"I found the love of my life. We share two beautiful children — three children, (Randall's) older daughter. It's the best thing ever. \n\"I don't wanna say do it like I do it, but I don't need a paper to be a devoted partner and devoted mother. I don't need to be told to be ever present in the hardest of times. I don't need to be told to weather a storm with a good man,\" she had said. ",

        "Sunscreen is undoubtedly one of the most important elements and most talked-about products when it comes to skincare. Here are some common myths around sunscreen busted. \nHave you ever wondered if all of those myths you heard about sunscreens are even real? Does a higher SPF mean it needs no reapplication? Will you get a tan even after applying sunscreen? And why is it necessary for you to protect your skin from harmful UV rays? \nSunscreen is undoubtedly one of the most important elements and most talked-about products when it comes to skincare, but also has some myths surrounding it. Here are common sunscreen myths and also know the significance of wearing sunscreen. \n5 common myths around sunscreen \nMyth 1: I only need sunscreen on sunny days \nA cloudy day might seem like a time to skip your sunscreen. But just because we can't see the sun doesn't mean its harmful UV rays can't cause damage. It's important to wear broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 50 no matter what the weather. For long lasting protection against sun damage during monsoon opt for a water-resistant sunscreen with a matte finish. \nMyth 2: Higher SPF means I can stay longer in the sun without reapplying \nSun Protection Factor (SPF) is an indication of how effectively a sunscreen protects you from harmful UVA & UVB rays. It is not indicative of the duration of protection it provides. Even with sunscreen with a higher SPF, you need to reapply it every 2-3 hours for effective sun protection. \nMyth 3: I don't need sunscreen if I am wearing makeup with SPF \nWhile some cosmetics contain SPF, relying solely on makeup for sun protection is not advisable. Sometimes, makeup application alone is not enough to reach the advertised amount of SPF protection. Additionally, the coverage may not be uniform across the face, leaving areas vulnerable to sun damage. It's best to use sunscreen under makeup to ensure adequate and even application. \nMyth 4: Sunscreen will protect me from getting a tan \nApplying sunscreen doesn't completely block the sun rays from reaching your skin, but it filters out harmful UVA/UVB radiation. Daily sunscreen application can protect your skin from sun damage and reduce the risk of skin cancer. However, one can still experience tanning after excessive sun exposure. \nMyth 5: I need sunscreen only for the summers \nSun is out throughout the year even during monsoon, so why skip sunscreen? Including sunscreen in your daily skincare routine should be a consistent practice to protect your skin from sun damage and keep it healthy. \nThese myths shouldn't stop us from enjoying the outdoors. Being consistent with sunscreen is the one and only step required to keep your skin protected.",

        "If films like Heat and Sexy Beast are anything to go by, when you're in the professional heist business, retirement does not come easily. There's always that one last job you get called in to tie up some loose ends, rekindling greed and the drive to plan elaborate robbery schemes within you. With the old gang rounded up, Payday 3 now takes us to the bustling streets of New York City, several years after our reign of terror in Washington DC, masked-up and prepared for new challenges in a present-day environment of mass surveillance gadgets, cryptocurrency, the deep web, and more. Having spent a few hours in the internal playtest, followed by the ongoing closed beta, I must say that I'm truly impressed with how streamlined this sequel is shaping up to be. \nThe test version only came with one location, the SCB Bank, which is carrying an unusually big amount of cash in its vault, awaiting transport. In what feels like a familiar callback to the Payday 2 days, this is your standard bank heist mission, sticking to the four-player co-op shooter formula, that has you bring a personalised loadout of weapons and high-tech gadgets to ease your cashout. Your approach can heavily vary between sneaking in and out without triggering any alarms, or you could take the loud route and blast in with guns blazing, striking fear into the hearts of the civilians. My experience with Payday 3 was a mix of both, starting by meticulously lockpicking my way through the backdoors to eventually culminating in an all-out assault, where my team was surrounded by cops from every angle. \nInterestingly though, there's a bit more freedom in stealth segments, where previously, simply being spotted in restricted areas would set the alarms off. But here, you can trespass in private staff areas or behind counters without wearing a mask and the guards would politely escort you to the nearest public area without ruining your stealth attempt. You only get one slip-up, though. Not to mention, it's a more realistic depiction of how security would react in a given situation. What I did find perplexing, however, was how you could freely walk up to windows in the lobby of the bank and press a button to close the shutters without raising suspicion. While this would prevent passersby from being able to peer inside the building and watch my team take everyone hostage, its inclusion feels very off-putting — almost as if it was an oversight from developer Starbreeze Studios. Hopefully, it's addressed in a sensible manner, closer to launch. Regardless, it's a massive step up from Payday 2, where you mostly just avoided detection and intimidated security. \nYou can do more with your mask off \nWell, what was I doing back there, you ask? Scouting, mostly. Keeping track of important rooms and cameras, and quietly sneaking behind guards to pickpocket keycards that would grant access to the main security control room. This allowed me to hack into and disable the security system without too much hassle — such actions are all tied to a single button press, ‘F'. Stealth is still extremely difficult to pull off though, especially once you put on heist masks to conceal your identity, whereupon being spotted, witnesses would immediately report your presence. However, I did feel a bit pressured into wearing a mask, because there were certain basic mechanics, such as vaulting over surfaces, that Payday 3 kept locked behind the mode. Without a mask, you cannot climb through windows nor can you brandish a pistol. That said, it's still quite insane how far you can progress in the game with masks off — as opposed to Payday 2 — so with the remaining time, I'd just run around the block to look for any potential escape routes that wouldn't draw attention. \nOnce you put on a mask, you can't take it off anymore, immediately raising the stakes for the heist, as you're finally allowed to partake in more nefarious activities. Now equipped with guns, your squad can walk around intimidating civilians into submission and tying them up, check corners for cameras and shoot them down, and snap security guards' necks for no disruptions. I'd recommend investing in a silencer for your pistol ASAP, in order to avoid creating a ruckus, but the most important toolkit in your arsenal would be to remain alert at all times. Dropping guards triggers a small alarm on their radio/ walkie-talkie, which if left unanswered, raises suspicion among the security team. Other times, an unattended civilian might escape and pull an alarm, throwing a wet blanket over your perfect plan. Things could easily go sideways once the mask is on, so it's best to have a team you could always rely on. \nSuch nail-biting sequences are peppered throughout Payday 3, though they can be severely eased by evenly dividing tasks among you. There's a lot more flexibility in how you approach missions, such as sifting through documents for clues on how to open the vault, intuitively following red cables to shut down power to the gates, or grabbing an executive to scan their retina on the bank's high-tech lock system. Of course, none of this would've been possible without numerous failed attempts, where my team and I almost immediately set off alarms, causing the police to come barging in. That's the beauty of Payday 3 — there's always something new to learn through repeated tries, making it more rewarding for the experienced players. \nNow, you might be wondering how the early games in Payday 3 would work for newer players. Well, usually super loud, because you have zero clue of what's going on or how things work. So, you'll end up drawing all kinds of unwanted attention, shooting every guard in sight, and grabbing civilians as body shields to help with negotiation, before getting bored soon enough that you let go of them and shoot them in the back of the head. Guilty as charged. I mean, no witnesses if everyone's dead, right? \nSpeaking of going loud, the bank heist mission has you breaking into the vault from the floor above in an aggressive fashion, where you collect bags of thermite, pile them up, and ignite them to gradually breach through the fortified wall. Of course, there are bells and sirens going crazy all around, which just adds to the tension as more cops start storming into the place. There is some method to this madness though, as adding too much thermite to increase the rate of breaching causes the water sprinklers to turn on, effectively reducing the flames and sending you on an errand run to turn it off. \nImproved combat, more unpredictability \nThe combat is a strong highlight in Payday 3, throwing increasingly challenging enemies at you, which gets pretty overwhelming, even with human teammates. While it might seem too daunting and overly difficult for some, the heat level perfectly ties with the premise, where you're trying to steal a truckload's worth of cash — it's a pretty serious crime you're committing here. You should get punished for making careless moves like not checking corners or standing out in the open and tanking bullets Tropic Thunder style. Taking the fight to the streets with bags of cash strapped to our shoulders is where I had the most fun, mimicking the chaos from the iconic LA shootout scene in Michael Mann's Heat (1995). \nAs you await your getaway vehicle and run back in to grab more cash, you engage in an all-out battle with hordes of different police types, including far-away snipers who've got their laser sights trained on you. I'll admit, they appear a lot more scary than they actually are — in the sense that the snipers are very slow to react to movement. So, you'll generally have an easy time dealing with them, as long as you keep sliding around the map. Don't completely ignore them though, as a single shot from them will instantly deplete your armour, leaving your body exposed to direct hits. \nWhatever tactics you had planned at the start of a heist session are completely thrown out of the window at this stage, leaving you to rely on any armour or medic bags you brought along. In merely 10 to 15 minutes since the alarms sounded off, the tone of the game will have changed entirely to a modern-day warzone, with special enemies like the Grenadier who will chuck highly damaging poison bombs, which not only blur our vision but prevents us from sprinting until we step out of the gas. The near-indestructible Bulldozer also returns, armed with powerful firearms and occasionally charging headfirst into you. It's best to have all four teammates focus on this behemoth at once since trying to take him down solo would result in guaranteed death or quick depletion of resources. \nThe Heavy SWAT team also consists of a brutish riot shield user, who would bash and stun you if you get too close. I found it super beneficial to just hurl a grenade behind them, causing them to turn around and expose their bodies to my onslaught. Another powerful unit relies on stun guns as well, though none of them seemed to be affected by the difficulty modifiers. All difficulty increments — at least in the Payday 3 closed beta — were based solely on security measures, such as indestructible cameras and a lead guard. This ensured that the enemies you faced in combat had the same health pool across the board, without turning them into mundane bullet sponges. \nAll of this is bolstered by a robust skill tree, opening room for you to experiment with various builds, whereby performing certain stealth or assault-based actions, you'll gain bonuses in terms of movement speed, inflicted damage, faster reload speeds, and more. For instance, investing skill points into Tank stats grants defence-oriented perks such as effective armour, while favouring Hacking lets you take remote control of security cameras. You could also double down on stealth abilities to perform faster takedowns and lockpicks or gain ‘Rush' buffs to escape into hiding quickly. In addition to working toward a setup specifically tailored for you, one could also synergise them with teammates to see which ones offer better success rates. \nJust like Payday 2, cash earned from heists can be spent on new weapons and their respective attachments such as scopes, muzzles, and grips to help with heavy recoil. All changes to guns' stats are neatly shown via a graph, and they can all be personalised with cosmetic mods like paint jobs, stickers, and charms. This forms the core gameplay loop of Payday 3, though for now, I have no idea how the larger story ties into this — after all, we reunited after years to identify and crush an undisclosed ‘new threat.' \nFurther, you could customise your characters' appearance with new suits, gloves, and a medley of creepy-looking masks, including the white, perforated hockey one that Robert De Niro wore in Heat! Not to mention, all armour and protective gear is worn underneath your suit, so you don't need to worry about making a bad impression. \nFinal thoughts \nHaving only played one heist level, Payday 3 comes across as a remarkable evolution from its predecessor's ethos, focusing on mechanical depth through a myriad of new high-tech toys to mess around with. The emphasis on stealth opens room for creativity, giving you the incentive to scout locations more freely and tick past an array of meticulous objectives, before donning the mask and going berserk. I also think it's an excellent choice for this threequel to be set in a contemporary timeline, given the game is designed to grow over time with a regular flow of post-launch content, so it should hopefully feel timeless.

        'In India, these staple foods are not only budget-friendly and easily accessible but also represent two principal sources of carbohydrates. \nWeight loss is inarguably the most searched topic on the internet, and numerous opinions abound regarding the role of carbohydrate elimination in expediting this process. This phenomenon often leads individuals to forgo rice and roti, especially during dinner, in hopes of sidestepping excess fat accumulation. However, the question persists: Do these quintessential Indian staples genuinely contribute to weight gain? Is it sustainable to entirely eschew rice and roti? This enduring quandary within the realm of health and nutrition has left us ensnared in a web of confusion, oscillating between fact and fiction. But the era of uncertainty ends now. Determined to discern the truth and quash this misconception once and for all, we embarked on an investigation. In this pursuit, we stumbled upon a post by dietician Richa Gangani, elucidating whether rice or roti can grace our dinner tables. As per her expert opinion, "You need not bid adieu to either of them to facilitate weight loss." \nAre Carbohydrates Really Bad For Your Health? \nLet\'s address the matter forthrightly - carbohydrates stand as a pivotal nutrient that sustains our vitality and energy levels throughout the day. Now, the inquiry arises: Why is carbohydrate singled out as the primary \'culprit\' behind weight gain? This designation stems from the fact that a significant portion of our carbohydrate intake consists of refined carbs, which precipitate rapid spikes in the body\'s glucose levels, consequently ushering in an array of associated health issues, including weight gain and diabetes risk. Instead of completely forsaking carbohydrates, the prudent approach involves identifying healthful sources and integrating them into our daily dietary regimen. For those unfamiliar, unprocessed foods enriched with protein and fibre, and boasting a low glycemic index are hailed as commendable sources of carbohydrates. \nIs It Safe To Have Rice And Roti For Dinner? \nIn India, rice and roti reign as dietary staples. These staple foods are not only budget-friendly and easily accessible but also represent two principal sources of carbohydrates. Beyond that, rice and roti pack a punch of indispensable vitamins and minerals, essential for fulfilling our daily nutritional needs. According to Richa Gangani, "Rice and chapati each offer distinct health benefits. While rice and dal, when combined, present a complete protein source with all essential amino acids, having chapati crafted from barley, sorghum, finger or pearl millet, along with a dash of wheat as a binding agent, can supply nutrients such as calcium, phosphorus, and zinc." This underscores that relinquishing either rice or roti could entail missing out on comprehensive nourishment essential for overall well-being. \nGangani advocates for portion control as the crux of effective weight loss, stating, "By managing your meal portions, you can relish both without hesitation. No particular grain should bear the blame for inducing weight gain." \nThe Bottom Line \nAfter reading through this article, are you considering getting rice and roti back to your dinner plate?

        'New Delhi: Lindsay Lohan, who welcomed a baby boy last month, shared a postpartum picture of herself on her Instagram profile. She wrote in her caption, "I am so proud of what this body was able to accomplish during these months of pregnancy and now, recovery. Having a baby is the greatest joy in the world." Later in her caption, the actress also made a reference to her iconic 2004 comedy film Mean Girls and she wrote, "Because I\'m not a regular mom, I\'m a postpartum mom." Lindsay tweaked a dialogue from the film - the one where Regina George\'s mom says, "I\'m not a regular mom. I am a cool mom." We got you, Cady. \nThe comments section of Lindsay Lohan\'s post totally passed the vibe check. Jonathan Bennett, who played Aaron Samuels in the 2004 comedy, wrote, "You\'ve never looked more beautiful." Paris Hilton commented, "Congratulations." Julia Fox\'s comment read, "Congratulations!! You\'re gonna be such an amazing mommy." The Instafam didn\'t miss the Mean Girls reference either. "Love the mean girls reference! Iconic," wrote a user. "You\'re not a regular mom. You\'re a cool mom," added another. "This caption. You go mama coco, you go," read another. Might we add, Lindsay Lohan looks so fetch (IYKYK). \nLindsay Lohan had announced her pregnancy in March. The actress\' rep confirmed to Entertainment Tonight the arrival of the baby boy and said last month, "The family is over-the-moon in love." Lindsay Lohan has been married to Bader Shammas since 2022. \nThe Mean Girls star was previously engaged to Russian millionaire Egor Tarabasov. However, the relationship ended in 2017. Lindsay Lohan is best known for her roles in films such as The Parent Trap, Freaky Friday, Confessions Of A Teenage Drama Queen, to name a few.',

        "We present a selection of nourishing alternatives that can replace maida. These flours are packed with nutrition, and you need not worry about gaining extra kilos. \nRefined flour (maida) holds an integral place in our daily diet, finding its way into cherished street foods and desserts like bhatura, pooris, samosas, cakes, and brownies. The delectable flavour that has us craving for these treats comes from maida. However, the truth remains that refined flour undergoes extensive processing, which removes nutrients from it too. This makes the food quite unhealthy, especially for those determined to shed stubborn belly fat. We understand the challenge of resisting these cravings, and thus, we present a selection of nourishing alternatives that can replace maida. These flours are packed with nutrition, and you need not worry about gaining extra kilos. \nWhat Can Replace Refined Flour? Here are 5 Healthy Substitutes: \n1. Whole Wheat Flour \nWhole-wheat flour (atta) is one of the best alternatives to refined flour. Since whole wheat is made using the entire kernel and undergoes less processing, it is able to retain all the essential nutrients. It is high in fibre, which keeps you full for longer and prevents binge eating at odd hours, making it an ideal addition to your weight loss diet. \n2. Oat Flour \nIf you want to boost your protein intake, then oat flour is the best option for you. It is also a rich source of fibre and healthy fats, further adding to its nutritional value. Several studies suggest that it may also help reduce cholesterol levels. You can buy oat flour from the market or even make your own at home by simply grinding the oats in a processor. \n3. Chickpea Flour \nAnother great alternative to refined flour is chickpea (besan) flour. Made from chickpeas, it is high in protein and can help promote a feeling of fullness. Protein is an essential nutrient when trying to lose weight, and chickpea flour provides it in abundance. You can use it to make delicious dishes such as cheela, dhokla, and more. \n4. Bajra Flour \nIf you're looking for a gluten-free option, bajra flour is an excellent choice. It is low in calories, packed with fibre, and may also help in managing blood sugar levels. Incorporating bajra flour into your daily meals can aid in weight loss management. It's an extremely versatile flour that can be used to make a wide variety of dishes. \n5. Ragi Flour \nRagi flour is enriched with essential nutrients and helps facilitate weight loss. It is also a good source of dietary fibre and will keep you satiated for longer periods. It is gluten-free and also suitable for people suffering from diabetes. With so many benefits, you must consider swapping maida for ragi flour from now on. Use it to make rotis, dosas, or even baked goods. \nSwap refined flour with these healthy alternatives and see your belly fat melt away with time. Stay fit and healthy!",

        "Antidepressants are medications used to treat depression and other mood disorders. They work by balancing chemicals in the brain that affect mood and emotions, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. These medications can be prescribed by healthcare professionals and come in various forms. \nAntidepressants can have side effects, although they vary depending on the specific medication and the individual. Understanding these side effects can help one better prepare for a treatment of antidepressants. Continue reading as we discuss some of the common symptoms of antidepressants. \n13 Side effects of taking antidepressants: \n1. Nausea and vomiting \nMany individuals experience stomach upset and may feel nauseous or vomit shortly after taking antidepressants. \n2. Headaches \nHeadaches are a common side effect, often observed during the initial stages of antidepressant use. They generally subside with continued treatment. \n3. Insomnia or sleep disturbances \nSome antidepressants can disrupt sleep patterns, causing difficulties falling asleep or staying asleep throughout the night. \n4. Weight gain or weight loss \nCertain antidepressants are associated with changes in appetite, leading to weight gain or loss. This can vary depending on the individual's response to the medication. Certain antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are known to cause weight gain in some individuals. \n5. Sexual dysfunction \nAntidepressants can impair sexual desire, arousal, and performance, leading to sexual dysfunction in both men and women. \n6. Insomnia or drowsiness \nAntidepressants may disrupt sleep patterns, leading to either difficulty falling asleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. Many individuals experience increased fatigue or drowsiness when starting an antidepressant regimen. This can impair their daily functioning and productivity. \n7. Anxiety or worsening of existing anxiety symptoms \nIn some cases, antidepressants can temporarily increase anxiety symptoms before they start showing improvement. This is more common in people with pre-existing anxiety disorders. \n8. Dry mouth \nDry mouth is a common side effect of several antidepressant medications. This can cause discomfort and increase the risk of dental issues. \n9. Sweating \nSome individuals may experience excessive sweating while taking antidepressants. This can lead to feelings of discomfort and self-consciousness. \n10. Emotional blunting \nA subset of individuals may experience emotional blunting or a decrease in emotional intensity while on certain antidepressants. This may result in reduced ability to experience pleasure or exhibit emotions. \n11. Agitation or jitteriness \nCertain antidepressants can cause feelings of restlessness, nervousness, or irritability. This may also affect relationships with others. \n12. Dizziness or lightheadedness \nFeeling dizzy or lightheaded, especially when standing up or changing positions, is a potential side effect of antidepressants. \n13. Increased suicidal thoughts \nAlthough rare, some individuals may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts or behaviors when starting or changing doses of antidepressant medications. Close monitoring is crucial, especially in younger individuals. \nMost side effects are temporary and tend to subside as the body adjusts to the medication. However, if any side effects become severe or persistent, it is important to inform your healthcare provider for further guidance. Additionally, antidepressants may have potential interactions with other medications, so it's crucial to discuss your medical history and any other medications you are taking with your doctor.",

The actress had the nation mourning for her when she died in 2018 in Dubai. On her birth anniversary, legions of fans from across the world are celebrating her incredible talent. Sridevi's loved ones too have shared special posts on social media, in honour of the actress. A case in point is Sridevi's younger daughter Khushi Kapoor.

In an interaction with Pinkvilla, she said, \"I think [my biggest war was] definitely when I lost mom. I was shooting for Dhadak and dealing with her loss was quite tough. Somehow finding the will to keep working and a way to deal with all of these things happening in our lives was tough. Figuring that out was definitely the biggest war in my life.” \nEarlier this year, on the occasion of Sridevi's death anniversary, Janhvi Kapoor dropped an image and said, \"I still look for you everywhere mumma, still do everything I do hoping I'm making you proud.

        "Profit at its movies division plunged by two-thirds due to lower sales for television content as well as higher marketing costs. \nJapan's Sony on Wednesday said first-quarter profit tumbled due to weaker performances from its movies and financial businesses. \nIn April-June, operating profit slid 31 percent to JPY 253 billion ($1.8 billion or roughly Rs. 14,907 crore), in line with estimates. \nProfit at its movies division plunged by two-thirds due to lower sales for television content as well as higher marketing costs after the company released more films in theatres. \nOnce a consumer electronics giant, the conglomerate has transformed itself to focus more on entertainment, developing movies, music and games. It is also a leading maker of image sensors. \nIn May, Sony said it is examining a partial spin-off of its financial unit, which includes life insurance and banking, as it looks to invest in its entertainment businesses. \nSony has said it expects to sell 25 million PlayStation 5 consoles this financial year, in what would be a record for a PlayStation device, following the easing of supply chain snarls. \nCumulative sales of the console have topped 40 million. \nNintendo last week reported it has sold 18.5 million units of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom since its release in May, helping driving sales of its aging Switch console. \nGaming market research firm Newzoo said Tuesday that global video games market would return to growth in 2023 on the back of strong sales of consoles such as Sony's PlayStation 5. Newzoo said it expects industry revenue to rise 2.6 percent to $187.7 billion (roughly Rs. 15,54,231 crore) in 2023, driven by a 7.4 percent rise in console sales in the year.

        "The age-old debate surrounding whether cold water is beneficial or detrimental to our bodies still remains somewhat unresolved. Is sipping on ice-cold water a rejuvenating habit or a potential risk? Well, the truth is that there are arguments on both sides. Many people refrain from consuming cold water, assuming it could harm their health or hinder their weight loss efforts. Cold water might pose certain health risks in specific situations, but it also offers numerous health benefits that you should be aware of. \nPros and Cons of Drinking Cold Water: \nFirst, let's examine the benefits of drinking cold water. \nBenefits of Cold Water: \n1. Boosts Metabolism: \nImagine this scenario - a glass of icy water and your metabolism kicking into high gear. Several studies suggest that consuming cold water could lead to a temporary boost in metabolic rate. When your body works to raise the temperature of the cold water to match your internal temperature, you may end up burning a few extra calories. It's akin to a mini workout for your digestive system! \n2. Ideal For Hydration: \nCold water is often gulped down more rapidly than its lukewarm counterpart, resulting in improved hydration levels. Maintaining proper hydration is crucial for your body's overall functionality. \n3. No Risk Of Weight Gain: \nAs per the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics, drinking cold water supports the weight loss process by aiding in low-fat intake throughout the day. Regardless of whether the water is cold, warm, or at room temperature, it contains no calories. Therefore, even if you opt for cold water, you won't gain weight (contrary to popular belief). \n4. Beats The Heat: \nOn a scorching day or after an intense workout, nothing is as refreshing as a sip of cold water. Cold water can assist in lowering your body temperature, heart rate, and perceived exertion. This rapid cooling effect can facilitate quicker recovery, making cold water a hydration hero. \n5. Aid For Pain Relief: \nCold water could potentially be your ally in alleviating discomfort caused by headaches or muscle soreness. The chilly temperature can aid in constricting blood vessels, reducing inflammation, and dulling pain sensations. \nPotential Risks of Drinking Cold Water: \n1. Digestive Distress: \nWhile that icy beverage might be cooling you down, it could also be causing your digestive system to contract, especially if your digestion is sensitive. Cold water can constrict blood vessels in the stomach, potentially slowing down digestion and causing discomfort for certain individuals. \n2. Could Be Detrimental For Kidneys: \nAccording to nutritionist Shilpa Arora, \"Cold water weakens the kidneys. To avoid this situation, refrain from drinking cold water with meals, as it can solidify oily food, potentially disrupting the body's balance. \n3. Aggravates Cold Symptoms: \nA study published in the National Library of Medicine suggests that drinking cold water can lead to thicker nasal mucus. Thus, if you are experiencing a cold or a cough, it's advisable to steer clear of cold water \nSo, Should You Opt for Cold Water or Not? \nAs of now, there is no scientific evidence that definitively labels cold water as harmful to health. Based on various studies, it's advisable to avoid cold water if you have a sensitive digestive system, an ongoing cold or cough, or a medical condition that doesn't react well to cold water. In fact, cold water provides immediate hydration on hot, humid days. However, if you were to ask experts to choose the best option among cold, warm, and room temperature water, most would recommend consuming water at room temperature throughout the year.",

        'William Friedkin, who died on Monday, will forever be remembered for his Oscar-winning The Exorcist \nUS director William Friedkin, who died Monday, will forever be remembered for his Oscar-winning The Exorcist in 1973, one of the most controversial horror films of all time that still chills new generations of moviegoers. The taboo-breaking scene of a 12-year-old girl, believed to be possessed by the devil, foul-mouthed and feverishly masturbating with a crucifix on her bed, provoked frenzy in audiences and sparked a global debate about the occult in the Catholic Church. \n"It was shocking," wrote Rolling Stone in 2018, recalling the first reactions. It "had people lining up at the entrances of movie theatres while the exits were soppy with puke from the previous showing." \nRemarkably for a horror film, it was nominated for 10 Oscars and took home two. \nPact with the devil \nWilliam Friedkin, who died in Los Angeles on Monday at the aged of 87, after suffering health issues in recent years, first hit the pinnacle in Hollywood a few years before The Exorcist - with his stomping, stylish 1971 thriller The French Connection. \nStarring Gene Hackman as a cop in gritty, corrupt New York City, the film won five Oscars including Best Director and Best Picture. It was a pearl of the "New Hollywood" wave of socially and politically charged filmmaking associated with emerging directors such as Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese. \nWilliam Friedkin was asked to direct The Exorcist - based on a novel inspired by a reported case of possession of a 14-year-old boy - after other star directors including Stanley Kubrick had turned it down. \n"I thought it was a film about the mystery of faith... but I didn\'t set out to make a horror film," William Friedkin was quoted saying in The Hollywood Reporter in 2015. "But by now, I have accepted that it is." \nHis film was followed by four sequels, based on the same novel but without William Friedkin\'s participation, together grossing more than $600 million world wide. A television series began in 2016. \nReal power \nWilliam Friedkin was born in Chicago in 1935. His mother was a nurse and his father held several jobs, from merchant seaman and semi-professional softball player to discount-clothes salesman. \nHe singled out a viewing in his twenties of Orson Welles\' Citizen Kane (1941) as having a radical impact. "It changed my life," he said in a 2014 interview published on the website of respected US critic, Roger Ebert. "It made me understand that film was an art form and a unique way of storytelling that I had never considered." \nWilliam Friedkin started working in television as a runner and then directed TV shows before making his own documentary in 1962, The People vs Paul Crimp, about a real-life death row prisoner. \nThe film would contribute to Crimp\'s death sentence being commuted, convincing William Friedkin of "the power of cinema", he told AFP in an interview in 2017. \nIn 1967 he made his first feature, Good Times, a musical starring the popular pop duo Sonny and Cher. \nEclipse from the A-List \nAfter his heyday in the 1970s, came a spectacular fall from the Hollywood A-List. It was his ambitious Sorcerer (1977), that would prove William Friedkin\'s undoing. \nAfter a difficult shoot that went wildly over budget to cost $22 million, the film bombed at the US box office, grossing just under $6 million. \nIt was also eclipsed by the first instalment of George Lucas\'s Star Wars, released at the same time. \nAmongst his other flops from a total of about 20 features was Cruising (1980) with Al Pacino as an undercover cop hunting down a serial killer in New York\'s S&M scene. \nBut Killer Joe in 2011, starring Matthew McConaughey as a man plotting to kill his own mother, brought renewed critical praise. \nIn 2018, decades after his most famous hit, William Friedkin revisited the themes of The Exorcist with the documentary The Devil and Father Amorth, about a priest performing an exorcism in Italy. \n"The life of a film maker is one film to another," William Friedkin told the LA Times in 1989 about how he picked himself up after his career had taken a tumble. \n"There\'s a great reward when you connect with the public and people are lining up around the block to see your film. But the real joy is making the film." \nWilliam Friedkin was married four times, the first time to one of France\'s top actresses, Jeanne Moreau.',

        "Can India scale to meet the challenges of a global engineering and manufacturing ecosystem? \nAccording to Intel, approximately 14,000 full-time staff and thousands more contract workers are based out of its Bengaluru campus, working on everything from CPU and GPU design to developing all kinds of software. This is Intel's largest R&D centre outside the USA, and people here collaborate with teams in multiple other countries. Of these, 3,000 people are dedicated to the company's Data Centre and AI Group, which is responsible for the Xeon CPU line, dedicated high-performance GPUs, custom silicon called FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays), and all the interconnects and supporting hardware and software that make them work. You might not see these products in the usual hardware shops, but they go into many of the servers that power today's major websites and online services as well as supercomputers such as the recently completed Aurora. \nGadgets 360 got the chance to participate in a conversation with Sandra Rivera, Intel Executive Vice President and General Manager, Data Centre and AI Group, who was visiting the Bengaluru campus this week. Here are some excerpts from the conversation, about the company's thoughts on its ambitions for its team here, India as a datacentre market, and the future of computing needs, among many other things. \nOn Intel's team in India and the work engineers here do: \nSandra Rivera: They're working on our CPUs. They're working on our FPGAs. They work on our GPUs and AI accelerators. The team here is critical for everything in the datacentre portfolio; hardware and silicon development. That's the Gaudi portfolio, so Gaudi 2 and 3, which is coming to market next year. The team here is this open development team that is actually delivering that product together with our team in Israel. We have software development in Poland, and we of course do work in the US as well, but primarily most of that development is happening in India and in Israel. \nWe built up the team after the acquisition [of Habana Labs]; that's a new investment that we made four-ish years ago now, and we're very proud of what that team has done. The quality, execution discipline, and competitiveness of the portfolio is excellent, and we're very excited about how much demand we're seeing for those products. \nOn investing more in India, and where there is potential for growth: \nSandra Rivera: Some of the opportunities that we see are in the buildup of the ODMs, OEMs, and the electronics manufacturing industry. [Some of the ones we have relationships with] across the globe are seeing an opportunity in India. They're investing in India and we're investing with them. We work so deeply with the ecosystem. If you look at what we've done over the decades in Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, and other parts of the world with the supply chain, we think a lot of that's going to happen here. So electronics manufacturing, we think, is a wonderful opportunity. We will be investing in the ecosystem. We'll be partnering with them to make sure that they can deliver products to market and you'll see many of the the multinational companies that are in the the server and ODM businesses coming here. We think it's exciting. \nWe've invested over $9 billion in India in our time here. We actually have a couple of new buildings that we put up a year or two before COVID, and now they're filling up again, which we like to see. But beyond that, I don't have anything specific in terms of a dollar amount. \nOn manufacturing in India and whether the workforce here is competitive enough to scale along with the rest of the world: \nSandra Rivera: Of course India can scale! Of course India can meet the moment. This is a huge market; the number of STEM graduates that are coming out of Indian universities; the workforce; the growth of the middle class; the knowledge workers... we think it's a wonderful growth market and opportunity. So there's absolutely no reason why India can't be a technology leader and a manufacturing leader in the world. \nIn fact one of the things I am most happy to see is that the number of women graduating with technical degrees is actually outpacing the number of men here. I think it's a wonderful opportunity for more women to enter the tech workforce, and Intel is a huge supporter of diverse workforces and all of the goodness that comes from having a rich, diverse tapestry of employees. So I think there's excellent silicon development skills. Every single one of my critical programs: CPU, GPU, AI, accelerators, and FPGAs; we have those skills here. There is of course a lot of software talent here and has been for decades, and we know that software is the big unlock of the capabilities in hardware. So we see that as a huge growth initiative. \nOne of the things that I think Israel has been a leader in, and certainly Silicon Valley also, is in terms of startups and and entrepreneurial culture. We see that really growing tremendously in India; more startups every day. India has now come to this high-tech market, leapfrogging a lot of the things that you didn't have to go through. When you look at US infrastructure, there's lots of cables, wires, and copper. India just kind of skipped over all of that and went right to wireless and 5G. [There's] so much innovative technology, and also innovative business models. The work that Reliance Jio and Tata have done here for years… I just think that there's so much faster progress because India can see what happened in other more mature markets and just skip over generations of technology that are not the leading edge. So it's an exciting time to be here and it's a wonderful market for us to serve and ecosystem to invest in. \nWe have a very technical workforce here and we'll continue to invest in hardware and software engineering, validation, and all of the work that it takes to build products. We will be partnering with our customers and the ecosystem as we see more of that data gravity and sovereignty, where data that is originated in India wants to be processed in India. All the infrastructure that will be built for that is clearly a core growth opportunity for our products. Working with the ecosystem and investing in software and hardware startups and partners, I think, is a great opportunity and exciting for us. \nOn India as a market, and overall goals here: \nSandra Rivera: So today it's small but growing. We see more datacentres and infrastructure buildout happening here. We certainly know that the amount of data being created [is growing]. Compute needs to come to where the data is created and consumed, and so I think that with the continued digitisation of India and every part of our lives, this will be a growing market for us. Historically, we've had excellent relationships with the telcos and communication service providers here. They're offering more services, and we see more payment applications and homegrown financial capabilities. We think that we're in the early days of just how big this market is going to be. We have a long history of investing early; we were the first ones in Taiwan, Israel, Vietnam and Malaysia. We like being on the ground floor of a growth opportunity.",

        "Alia Bhatt is seen alongside Gal Gadot and Jamie Dornan in Netflix's Heart Of Stone \nNew Delhi: Over the years, several stars from Bollywood – the biggest film industry in the country – have managed to crossover and work in Hollywood, which enjoys a larger international audience. Hollywood, being the epicentre of global filmmaking, has witnessed the convergence of talents from various backgrounds and needless to say Bollywood actors have often left a mark with their work. The latest addition to the list is Alia Bhatt, who has made a smashing debut with Heart Of Stone, the Netflix action project headlined by Gal Gadot alongside Jamie Dornan. With a gun in her hand and mouthing sinister dialogues — Alia Bhatt is a show-stealer. If you enjoyed the melange of the two industries, we recommend you take a look at this list which celebrates the best of Bollywood talent in Hollywood. \n1. Irrfan Khan in Life of Pi – Disney + Hotstar \nThe late Irrfan Khan needs no introduction. While it is tough to pick one project from his international filmography, his role as the adult Pi in Ang Lee's adaptation of Life of Pi left an indelible mark on the audience. Irrfan Khan's nuanced performance added depth and emotion to the film's exploration of survival and spirituality. Life of Pi is worth revisiting just for the sheer genius of the actor. \n2. Priyanka Chopra Jonas in Baywatch - Netflix \nPriyanka Chopra's transition from Bollywood to Hollywood came packaged in the form of the successful TV show Quantico, in which she played FBI agent Alex Parrish. However, the actress surprised fans with her maiden Hollywood film Baywatch, in which she opted to play the primary antagonist, Victoria Leeds. Her on-screen charisma in the action-comedy film was the talk of the town, proving that the actress is here to rule. The fun film is a perfect weekend watch and our OG Desi Girl only adds to the fun. \n3. Ali Fazal in Victoria & Abdul – Netflix \nAli Fazal is perhaps the one actor to have received the most diverse of roles in Hollywood within a span of a few years. One of his most important films is Victoria & Abdul, the historical drama where he shared screen space with the legendary Dame Judi Dench. He played the character of Abdul Karim, a member of Queen Victoria's staff, who goes on to strike an unlikely and oft-scrutinized friendship with the queen herself. \n4. Anupam Kher in Silver Linings Playbook  - Netflix \nIt would not be wrong to say that Anupam Kher's portrayal of Dr Patel in Silver Linings Playbook added a warm touch to the acclaimed romantic dramedy. Anupam Kher's inspired performance in the film, which deals with issues such as mental health and complexities of strained relationships, earned him rave reviews. \n5. Aishwarya Rai in The Pink Panther 2 - Prime Video \nAishwarya Rai has been courted by Hollywood for years now but the superstar has been picky with her projects in the West. So, when she joined the cast of the iconic The Pink Panther franchise fans were elated. In the film headlined by the inimitable Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau, Aishwarya played the role of the alluring Sonia Solandres with panache. \n So, grab your popcorn and enjoy the magic of cinema from around the world with a healthy dose of Bollywood.",

        "Kiara Advani shared that she had the privilege of visiting Kargil while promoting Shershaah. \nAmritsar: NDTV took Hindi film actor Kiara Advani to Attari, Amritsar for Jai Jawan to celebrate Independence Day with the Border Security Force (BSF) jawans. The show is a salute to the armed forces of our nation in which a Bollywood actor spends multiple days with jawans to not only live their lives but also honor what they do for us. Kiara's entry into the border outpost was marked by an overwhelming surge of emotions. \"It is surreal that we are so close to the border\", said the Shershaah actor. Kiara, known for her roles in films like Kabir Singh, Guilty, and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, confessed that it was her inaugural visit to a border area and she \"got goosebumps\" seeing men and women in the uniform. \nKiara recalled an incident on the set of Shershaah where her husband, Siddharth Malhotra, was shooting in his uniform. To maintain continuity, he wiped off the dust from his uniform for a retake. The army officers present on the site gently pointed out that they refrain from wiping off the soil from their uniforms, as it represents the very soil of their country-a subtle yet profound symbol of their commitment and connection to the land they protect. Kiara Advani and Sidharth Malhotra got married on Feb 7 this year. Their wedding pictures are the most-liked Instagram post in India. They shared screen space in Shershaah where their love story began. Kiara is currently working on 'Gamechanger', a pan-India film co-starring Ram Charan. \nKiara Advani's connection to the armed forces didn't stop at the border outpost. She shared that she had the privilege of visiting Kargil while promoting Shershaah a film that honored the real-life story of Captain Vikram Batra who was martyred in the Kargil war. This experience took her closer to the heart of the film and its themes, allowing her to immerse herself in the emotions and stories that inspired the narrative. We also introduced her to the multiple levels of security present at the border which includes fencing, barbed wires, farmlands, jawans with guns, and horses used for patrolling and chasing. Kiara interacted with women jawans patrolling at the outpost and had a special message for a jawan's daughter. Kiara's \"we are proud of your mother\" resonated well with all of us bringing heartfelt joy to the jawan's face. ",

Sunny Deol and Ameesha Patel\'s sequel of Gadar earned on Monday at over ₹ 38 crore. The number is quite close to its first day earning - ₹ 40.10 crore and, thus, it proves Gadar 2 is "unstoppable" at the box office right now. The total earnings of the movie now stands at over ₹ 173 crore and it\'s eyeing the ₹ 200 crore club. Taran Adarsh has mentioned in his tweet, mass pockets are driving its business to a great extent. \n"200 NOT OUT *TODAY*... #Gadar2 is UNSTOPPABLE... Continues its DREAM RUN on Monday... Monday *almost* AT PAR with Friday, UNBELIEVABLE... Sure to DEMOLISH *lifetime biz* of many biggies... Fri 40.10 cr, Sat 43.08 cr, Sun 51.70 cr, Mon 38.70 cr. Total: ₹ 173.58 cr. #India biz," tweeted Taran Adarsh. He added, "Biz in *mass pockets* - especially smaller centres - is an EYE-OPENER, brings back memories of #Sholay and #Gadar." \nGadar 2 released to average reviews. Film critic Saibal Chatterjee, in his review of NDTV, gave the film 2 stars out of 5 and he wrote, "Gadar 2 is strictly for three categories of people: Sunny Deol fans, those that miss the unbridled excesses of Bollywood of yore, and those that believe that "hate thy neighbour" is an axiom worth cheering for in a movie theatre. The film has enough to please them all - and then some." \nDirected by Anil Sharma, Gadar 2 is the sequel to the 2001 hit Gadar. In the sequel Sunny Deol, Ameesha Patel and Utkarsh Sharma have reprised their roles of Tara Singh, Sakeena and Jeete, respectively. The film released in theatres on Friday.

Allergic asthma is a common type of asthma where symptoms are primarily triggered by exposure to allergens and certain food allergies. When an allergic person with asthma comes into contact with these triggers, it can lead to an asthma attack or exacerbation of symptoms. The allergic response causes an immune reaction in the airways, resulting in inflammation and tightening of the muscles surrounding the air passages. This causes the characteristic symptoms of asthma. \nPeople with asthma should be cautious and aware of several allergies that may trigger or exacerbate their condition. In this article, we list some of the most common asthma-triggering allergies one should look out for. \nHere are 8 allergies that individuals with asthma should keep an eye on: \n1. Pollen \nPollen from trees, grass, and weeds can significantly affect people with asthma. When inhaled, pollen can irritate the airways, leading to asthma symptoms. \n2. Dust mites \nDust mites are tiny organisms that thrive in mattresses, pillows, carpets, and upholstery. Their waste particles can trigger asthmatic reactions in people who are allergic to them. \n3. Pet dander \nThe allergens present in the skin flakes, urine, or saliva of animals such as cats, dogs, or rodents can cause asthma symptoms. People with asthma should avoid close contact or exposure to such allergens. \n4. Mould \nMould spores can be found both indoors and outdoors. Damp areas like bathrooms, basements, or areas affected by water damage can facilitate mould growth, and inhaling mould spores can worsen asthma symptoms. \n5. Cockroaches \nCockroach droppings, saliva, and decaying body parts contain allergens that pose a risk to asthma sufferers. Making efforts to reduce cockroach infestations, keeping the house clean, and sealing any cracks or openings can minimise exposure. \n6. Certain foods \nWhile asthma is primarily a respiratory condition, certain food allergies, such as peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, and eggs, can trigger asthmatic reactions. Individuals with known food allergies should be cautious while consuming these allergenic foods. \n7. Strong scents and chemicals \nFor some people with asthma, strong odours like perfumes, cleaning agents, or chemicals can be a trigger. Ensuring good ventilation and avoiding exposure to such irritants can be helpful. \n8. Certain medications \nSome individuals with asthma may be allergic to specific medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), beta-blockers, or certain antibiotics. It is important to inform healthcare professionals about any known drug allergies to prevent potential asthma exacerbations. \nIt is worth noting that asthma triggers and allergies can vary from person to person. It is advisable for individuals with asthma to work closely with their healthcare provider or allergist to identify and manage their specific triggers to minimise the risk of asthma attacks.",

        "A couple of months ago, Motorola showcased its latest foldable, the Razr 40 Ultra. It had a radical-looking, futuristic design with floating cameras embedded into its near-bezelless cover display. The premium foldable instantly reinstated Motorola as a serious contender and became the challenger to Samsung's year-old Galaxy Z Flip 4. \nDespite years of having an upper hand in India, it appears that Samsung is now playing catch up this year by launching the Galaxy Z Flip 5 with a bigger outer display, which the company now calls ‘Flex Window'. But sporting a bigger cover display is only half the war won unless it's backed up by a rock-solid software experience, which Motorola's foldable did deliver. \nSo, does the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 have what it takes to retain its supremacy in the vertically folding smartphone segment in India? Let's find out. \nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 price in India \nSamsung's Galaxy Z Flip 5 has received a noticeable price hike over the Galaxy Z Flip 4, which was launched at Rs. 89,999. However, all of this seems justifiable given that it has the latest processor and starts with a base 256GB storage variant which is priced at Rs. 99,999. There's a 512GB storage variant as well and it's priced at Rs. 1,09,999. \nThe phone is available in four main colours – Mint, Graphite, Cream and Lavender. It is also available in three special edition finishes – gray, blue and green – which sport a matte-black frame. I received the 256GB variant in the Mint finish for review. \nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 design \nAs pointed out in our first impressions article, not much has changed in terms of visual appeal between the new Galaxy Z Flip 5 and the previous Galaxy Z Flip 4 models. The new device feels slimmer and more compact when folded thanks to its new hinge. The gap closer to the hinge which used to let in dust on the Galaxy Z Flip 4 no longer exists and it also makes the phone appear aesthetically pleasing, with both halves folding flat against one another. \nA major visual change is on the front half of the clamshell. The smaller window which hid the cover display of the previous model has now been expanded to accommodate a much bigger cover display. When folded and with the display powered down, it makes the phone appear like a short, chunky slab of black glass with a flattened metal border around it. \nBut power on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 and the cool-looking aesthetics disappear as you are greeted by some abnormally chunky borders on all sides with a weird folder-like cutout at the bottom to avoid the cameras and the accompanying LED flash unit. Indeed, this is quite the contrast compared to the radical cover display design of the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra. \nThe placement of the rest of the components on the Galaxy Z Flip 5 hasn't changed and remain the same as on the Galaxy Z Flip 4. Thankfully, Samsung's new hinge does not deprive it of its IPX8 rating which gives the phone credible water resistance against splashes of water, and is far better than the Razr's IP53 rating that's better with dust but offers basic protection against water. \nSo, does this new hinge in the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 reduce the crease on the main folding display? Not really. According to Samsung, the new hinge is supposed to be less prone to damage from drops and that it allows the device to appear slimmer when folded. The crease seems to be as intrusive as on the Galaxy Z Flip 4 and the resulting groove still feels out of place. \nMotorola and Oppo have done a better job with their hinge designs reducing the groove on their respective folding displays, but this comes at the cost of a lesser IP rating. As for the sturdiness of the inner display, it remains as robust and damage resistant as the previous one, which is best in class. Samsung's display aspect ratio also remains as narrow as its recent models, so typing still feels a bit cramped when compared to the broader display of the Oppo Find N2 Flip. \nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 specifications and software \nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 follows a formula which is very similar to its Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S23+ models launched earlier this year. This means that its core hardware changes are limited to a new processor which is expected to bring qualitative improvements in performance, battery life, and imaging. This year, that processor would be the top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform for Galaxy (a tweaked version of the standard processor), which fortunately for Samsung, has not been utilised in any of the clamshell foldable devices launched in India this year. \nCommunication standards include Wi-Fi 6e, Bluetooth version 5.3, NFC, support for the usual global positioning systems and a Type-C USB port with USB 3.2 (Gen 1) support. The device is powered by a 3,700mAh battery with 25W wired charging support, but Samsung does not include a charger in the box. The device also offers wireless charging at 15W. \nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 ships with One UI 5.1.1 which is based on Android 13. At the time of writing this review, the phone was running the slightly outdated May 1 2023 security patch. The software is typically Samsung and One UI, with plenty of customisation options on the main screen and the new Flex Window as well. \nSamsung has a number of card-like cover screen layouts (like a watchface on a smartwatch) that are quite customisable. You just have to remember that none of these cover screen designs (and respective buttons or indicators in them), save for the camera button, are interactive. For example, tapping on the pending notifications icon or a battery icon will not take you to the notifications area or the battery section. I found most of these designs to be purely cosmetic and not practical, requiring you to swipe through the long list of native widgets or just open up the main display to get what you seek. \nThe core idea behind the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra's practical cover display is not the fact that it can run full apps on it, but because it has a full-blown phone on the outside as well. Upon receiving a notification, you can simply swipe to expand it. This shows additional content and a set of action buttons (delete, reply, archive etc. for email apps) which lets you deal with a notification without getting into the app itself. \nSamsung's Flex Window misses out on this really important aspect. Swiping downwards or long-pressing a notification does absolutely nothing. Your only means of dealing with a notification is to either swipe it to dismiss it or tap to open it, which opens up a small card with truncated information depending on the app and whether it's supported by Samsung. \nJust like the Galaxy Z Flip 4, if you receive a notification from a messaging app, tapping on it reveals the whole message in a small card with a ‘reply' and a ‘clear' button at the bottom, followed by a list of predefined quick replies. However, you now have a pop-up keyboard on the cover display to type out custom replies if you tap on the ‘reply' button on the Galaxy Z Flip 5. \nIf you receive a notification from any other app category, tapping on the notification will expand to show a card with truncated information (part of the email in plain text), below which will be a ‘clear' button to dismiss the notification. This is basically a dead end and all you can do next is open the phone to read or glance through what's actually present in that notification, which can get very annoying. \nNow there is a third category of notifications which are to do with supported third-party apps. These would include the ones available in the Labs feature (which is still in beta) and lets you launch and view a handful of apps on the cover display itself. The problem with this is that tapping on a notification from this supported app will directly open the app. \nWhatsApp for example will bypass the standard ‘reply' and ‘clear' buttons treatment and directly open the chat window of the related conversation on the cover display itself. While this sounds exciting and fun, it does get quite tiring, because you have to keep jumping in and out of apps from the notifications area when dealing with such notifications. \nTo a casual user, these three categories of notifications can get extremely irritating because you have to keep in mind which app can reveal usable information (card with a reply button) and which cannot (a simple card). After dealing with this for a few days, I decided to just open up the main display to handle notifications from the drop-down tray like on a regular candybar smartphone. \nCurrently, the cover display only lets you launch a handful of apps. It isn't enabled by default and has to be enabled in the Labs section. This includes Google Maps, Messages, Netflix, WhatsApp and YouTube. According to Samsung, these apps have been optimised to run on the outer display, claiming that more apps will be added in the future. \nThe implementation works just fine for these supported apps and can help with getting things done without opening the main display. The cover display also supports app transitions from cover display to the main display, letting apps adapt on the fly to the tall aspect ratio of the main display. \nHowever, unlike the Razr, this cannot work the other way around as apps can only transition from the cover display to the main one and not vice versa (or when you fold the phone). \nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 performance \nWhile the cover display's interface is disappointing in its current state, the main display's software interface of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 performs quite well. There is no sign of stuttering or lag with One UI running flawlessly despite packing in some bloatware and third-party apps. Thankfully all of these third-party apps can be uninstalled, but it is a bit disappointing that a phone this expensive comes with them out of the box. \nAs for benchmarks, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 performed as expected. The phone managed a score of 12,87,359 points in AnTuTu and 1,998 and 5,176 points in Geekbench's single and multi-core tests respectively. These scores are easily the highest figures we have seen coming from a clamshell foldable smartphone till date. \nGaming performance was quite good and better than expected. While I wasn't satisfied by the Galaxy Z Flip 4's touch sampling rate when playing games like Call of Duty Mobile, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 does a lot better in this area. Yes, the phone does heat up a bit when running it at 'Very High' graphics and 'Max' framerate, but performance did not take a hit even after 30 minutes of competitive gaming. \nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5's 3.4-inch outer Super AMOLED display has a standard 60Hz refresh rate but feels smooth in terms of operation. There's a 6.7-inch full-HD+ AMOLED folding panel inside with a 120Hz refresh rate and its of the LTPO variety, so it can drop its refresh rate down to 1Hz when required to save battery life. Both displays produced saturated colours at default settings, but showed excellent sunlight legibility when viewed outdoors. The main display also supports HDR10+ playback and the dual speakers make for an immersive multimedia experience when watching movies or playing games. \nThe Galaxy Z Flip 5 lasted a good 16 hours and 45 minutes when put through our video loop battery test, but daily usage figures are a bit concerning. With regular use which involved scrolling through several social media apps, two email accounts on sync, about 30 minutes of camera usage, 30 minutes of gaming and an hour of video streaming and a few calls, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 was down to nine percent at six in the evening after being unplugged from the charger at 7am, which isn't great even for a foldable. \nThe main reason could be down to my reduced cover screen usage (mentioned in the software section), which would have been a great way to save on battery life, if done right. \nWhen plugged into a 61W USB PD charger, the phone managed a 26 percent charge in 30 minutes and took a good 2 hours and 14 minutes to complete the charge, which is very slow compared to the competition. Thankfully, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 still retains its wireless charging capability, which is good for trickle charging when the phone is not being used. \nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 cameras \nWith the Galaxy Z Flip 5, Samsung has for the third year in a row, maintained a similar camera system as its predecessor, bringing no new upgrades save for what the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC's ISP can deliver. The camera hardware remains unchanged over last year's Galaxy Z Flip 4, which was not too bad to begin with. \nThere's a 12-megapixel primary camera with OIS, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and a 10-megapixel selfie camera which is embedded into the main folding display. The camera interface is similar to what one can find on any Samsung smartphone, save for the fact that the Galaxy Z Flip 5's primary camera can also be used as a selfie camera. While this is possible on the Galaxy Z Flip 4, the Galaxy Z Flip 5's larger cover display makes using this mode and framing photos a lot easier. The bigger cover display also makes it possible to snap photos using the rear cameras in tent mode. \nOverall image quality remains very similar when compared to the previous model. The primary camera captures sharp-looking photos in daylight with the typically saturated colours we are used to from Samsung's smartphones. Details, although sufficient, are still on the lower side and far from the superior imaging capability of the similarly priced Galaxy S23. \nSamsung's Scene Optimiser is switched on by default and I kept it on for most of this review as the images weren't drastically enhanced (slightly saturated colours and warmer tones) when compared to the standard photos. Portrait photos captured using the same camera also came out just fine with decent edge detection, but the subjects often came out a bit overexposed and at times with clipped highlights. \nThe ultra-wide camera captures average photos in daylight but these images are low on resolved detail, especially in the shadows. \nSelfies captured in daylight come out sharp and clear with good edge detection in Portrait mode. However, the primary camera does a far better job at this with much better details and definition, which is why I would strongly recommend using it instead of the selfie camera. \nIn low light, the primary camera manages good details when using the auto-night mode (enabled by Scene Optimiser) or the dedicated Night mode. Just like the daylight photos, dynamic range comes up a bit short especially in the shadows. Street-lit scenes have average details and appear a bit oversharpened with crushed blacks in the shadows. The primary camera also has trouble locking focus in dimly-lit scenes, so the resulting photos come out soft, especially when using the Night mode. \nUnlike the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5's camera setup does not include a macro mode. However, the primary camera can focus on objects as close as 10-15cm and the results look just fine. \n4K 30fps recorded videos appears average in terms of details, with decent colour saturation but underexposed shadows. Stabilisation is not a problem when shooting at these settings either. 4K 60fps videos showcase a steady framerate but come out shaky. HDR10+ videos recorded at 4K 30fps did not look great even though it managed better detail in the shadows. Low-light video lacked noise, but this led to flattened or blotched textures. \nVerdict \nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 manages better image and video capability than the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra. But neither should be purchased for this reason alone as both are quite average compared to the competition. If you seek good camera and video quality, the Samsung Galaxy S23 is a much better choice, minus the folding tricks. \nBetween the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, I would pick the Razr because of its well-optimised cover display experience, which is currently second to none. Motorola's MyUX software experience also remains unmatched in terms of minimal bloatware and additional apps, and is also closer to a Google Pixel-like software user experience. Then, there's the fact that the Razr 40 Ultra also looks so much better with its slick design and that radical-looking cover display. \nWhere Samsung does stand out is when it comes to overall performance, optimisation and image quality. We've compared the Oppo Find N2 Flip with the Galaxy Z Flip 4 previously and Samsung did come out on top back then as well. However, its main standout feature isn't as useful as I expected it to be. If you own a Galaxy Z Flip 4, I'd recommend sticking with it for now.",

        "Having starred in two of the biggest international film franchises — Mission Impossible and Guardians of the Galaxy — actor Pom Klementieff has successfully managed to make a name for herself all over the world. However, the actor of Asian descent admits that there was a time when she was not considered for roles in Hollywood because of her accent. \n“At the moment when I look around, it feels amazing that everyone from all over the world has a chance to get a role in a film, which was not the case earlier,” says Klementieff, adding, “I remember it was hard to get cast (initially in my career) because I didn’t have the perfect American accent. But now, things are changing and it is exciting.” \nThe actor, therefore, feels her career graph directly reflects how the world of Hollywood has changed in terms of diversity and inclusivity. The 37-year-old mentions, “When I look back and then see what I am getting today, I only feel grateful. That’s because I remember the moments when I was struggling. So, it is beautiful to see from where I started and where I have reached.” \nThe actor, who was last seen in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, credits growing diversity in Hollywood for ushering in a change. “Today, there is more variety in terms of where people come from, their origins and descent. It’s interesting to show that onscreen. I have been lucky to work with incredible directors in my career who have been gentlemen and who love to portray women in interesting, flawed and beautiful ways, like my Mission Impossible franchise,” she says, further stating, “All the female characters in the MI franchise have their own agency. I love watching them on screen, even before being part of these films, I used to watch the characters.” \nTalking about the franchise, Klementieff gushes admits that the most special thing was to work with actor-producer Tom Cruise. \n“He is so inspiring. It was incredible to get to see from the front row on the set. He works so hard. The best thing is that he lets other people shine as well. That is the beauty of the film as well. Every character has a moment in the movie. It is not just about him,” she notes, sharing that working on the film introduced her to Indian cuisine, which she fell in love with. \n“When I was shooting in London, I used to eat a lot of Indian food, and it was so good. I love Indian food. Now, coming to India is on my bucket list. I have never been to the country and I’m dying to visit. Maybe, I will fulfil it with a visit to Delhi soon,” the actor ends with a promise to herself.",
